Jingo,"It isn't much of an island that rises up one moonless night from the depths of the Circle Sea—just a few square miles of silt and some old ruins. Unfortunately, the historically disputed lump of land called Leshp is once again floating directly between Ankh-Morpork and the city of Al-Khali on the coast of Klatch—which is spark enough to ignite that glorious international pastime called ""war."" Pressed into patriotic service, Commander Sam Vimes thinks he should be leading his loyal watchmen, female watchdwarf, and lady werewolf into battle against local malefactors rather than against uncomfortably well-armed strangers in the Klatchian desert. But war is, after all, simply the greatest of all crimes—and it's Sir Samuel's sworn duty to seek out criminal masterminds wherever they may be hiding and lock them away before they can do any real damage . . . even the ones on his side.",['Terry Pratchett'],Harper,2014-04-29,['Fiction'],0753108844,AQTM43PL9LAVW,3/3,5.0,1097798400,Another Brilliant Pratchett,"Once again Terry Pratchett mirrors the irreverence of our own world with this charming little novel concerning a war between a very western Ankh-Morpork and a very middle-eastern Klatch. As usual the references from literature and the history of the real world as well as aspects of current events wormed their way through that beautiful dimensional portal in Pratchett's brain to give us a delightful romp and thought provoking look at one of the most basic and primal human events. It was written in the finest tradition of the City Watch series which seem to always show that true duty and realism tend to win out over the insanity that the majority of the world engages in. Watch out for 71-Hour Ahmed and the rest of the D'Regs, but they even seem weak next to the power of Corporal Nobbs in a dress.

Of Mice and Men (Penguin Audiobooks),"Penguin Classics presents John Steinbeck’s classic tale as an eBook enhanced with ten exclusive video clips featuring students responses, questions for classroom discussions, and an American Dream assignment Nobel Prize-winner John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men remains one of America's most widely read and taught novels. An unlikely pair, George and Lennie, two migrant workers in California during the Great Depression, grasp for their American Dream. Laborers in California's dusty vegetable fields, they hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. For George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. When they land jobs on a ranch in the Salinas Valley, the fulfillment of their dream seems to be within their grasp. But even George cannot guard Lennie from the provocations, nor predict the consequences of Lennie's unswerving obedience to the things George taught him. Of Mice and Men: Teacher’s Edition includes the following: • An introduction and suggested further reading by Susan Shillinglaw, a professor of English at San Jose State University and Scholar-in-Residence at the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas • The poem “To a Mouse, On Turning Her Up in Her Nest with the Plough, November 1785” by Robert Burns (the original source of Steinbeck’s title Of Mice and Men) • The 1962 Nobel Banquet Speech by John Steinbeck • An exclusive audio interview with award-winning actor James Earl Jones on his stage performances in Of Mice and Men • Ten exclusive videos of students on major themes from the novel tied to group discussion questions included in the eBook, and an American Dream assignment, for the ultimate educational experience",['John Steinbeck'],Penguin,2013-01-03,['Fiction'],0140860096,A24M2KN27MDEXO,1/1,5.0,1064275200,The Best Book I Was Ever Forced To Read...,"Twice, once in a Junior High English Class and again in High School I was required to read John Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men."" Each time I have read it since, I have enjoyed it more and more. It is a brief, easy-to-read but emotionally resonant novel about two migrant workers set in the California countryside. As with most of Steinbeck's classic work, the prose is very discriptive while not being clunky or overly verbose. The themes of friendship and brotherly love are apparent on every page and aren't as emotionally manipulative as many books that try to be today. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read. Unlike many alleged ""classics"" I've been forced to read in class its actually a great book and I had no problem reading it outside of class (I couldn't say as much for A Farewell To Arms, but oh well :-) ). I would recommend this book for anyone from a mature junior high reader up. The violence might be a little much for someone younger than that (and might be a reason why the book has been, unfortunately, banned so many times).",2013,en
Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].,"First published in 1926, ‘The Sun Also Rises’ is Ernest Hemingway’s first novel and a classic example of his spare but influential writing style. A poignant look at the disillusionment and angst of the post-World War I generation, the novel introduces two of Hemingway's most unforgettable characters: Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. Based on Hemingway's experiences, it is the story of a group of American and English expatriates living in Paris who take an excursion to Pamplona, Spain. The novel has forever associated Hemingway with bullfights and the running of the bulls. This powerful work of modern fiction, filled with memorable characters and universal themes, is summarized in this volume, which is enhanced by thought-provoking critical extracts and focused biographical details. The novel helped to establish Hemingway as one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century.","['Ernest Hemingway', 'Digital Fire']",DIGITAL FIRE,2022-05-15,['Fiction'],B000MY6VHK,A2U2GKORNOMWTN,8/16,1.0,962668800,What the f--- was Hemingway smoking when he wrote this?,"Hemingway is a great writer - this book does nothing but degrade, demote, and humiliate him.

The only other Wilma she could think of was a Flintstone.Wilma loved animals, especially dogs. She always felt loved by her dog Reggie. At school she didn't fit in with the popular kids, and somehow it didn't make sense to hang out with the unpopular kids. Mostly, everyone ignored the eighth-grade girl.When she gave up her seat on the train for an old woman, the woman thanked her and told her that in order to repay her kindness, she would grant one wish. The woman looked old, but didn't sound like an old woman.Wilma, not believing the woman, said she wanted to be the most popular girl at her middle school.The wish was granted. Wilma's phone never stopped ringing. She had more than 25 invitations to the Grad night dance, and many were from the boyfriends of her new friends. But, the worries of her new popularity began early on. Do the new friends really like her? Will her popularity end when she graduates from middle school?Wilma didn't ever act like a popular girl. She included other unpopular kids in her new circle. She helped others with homework, and out of all the possible dates she could have for the dance, she chose an unpopular boy who also loved animals and had a crush on her even before the wish. Wilma handled things so well, I found myself rooting for her to be able to keep her new friends and boyfriend.This is a young adult book and may not be suitable for younger children. The story explores kissing, and teenage friendship issues.I look forward to reading other books by Gail Carson Levine.Jill Ammon VanderwoodAuthor: Through the RugThrough The Rug: Follow That Dog (Through the Rug)",2016,en
Down these mean streets,"Thirty years ago Piri Thomas made literary history with this lacerating, lyrical memoir of his coming of age on the streets of Spanish Harlem. Here was the testament of a born outsider: a Puerto Rican in English-speaking America; a dark-skinned morenito in a family that refused to acknowledge its African blood. Here was an unsparing document of Thomas's plunge into the deadly consolations of drugs, street fighting, and armed robbery--a descent that ended when the twenty-two-year-old Piri was sent to prison for shooting a cop. As he recounts the journey that took him from adolescence in El Barrio to a lock-up in Sing Sing to the freedom that comes of self-acceptance, faith, and inner confidence, Piri Thomas gives us a book that is as exultant as it is harrowing and whose every page bears the irrepressible rhythm of its author's voice.

Quinn seems to do this through her use of two story lines. The first is of a wealthy woman who has to escape her abusive husband and the second is the woman in a lifestyle that is common compared to how most American's live. She isn't completely wealthy and, in fact, tends to make her own belongings. She is able to hold a strong, romantic relationship with a paramedic and she has a roof above her head. In ""Hidden"", Tricia Campbell is the narrator which gives a psychological view of the stories events. This makes the story more intense for the reader. This is enhanced by the imagery that Quinn uses. Even if it is sometimes too intense, Quinn does have the ability to take the reader to the scene of the crime including the accident in which Scott McCall's life changed and the events leading up to Tricia Campbell's freedom from her husband.The problem with this story is that it went into intense descrptions about the sexual abuse that Tricia Campbell's husband gave her which could have been expressed in a less intense and more efficient manor.

I stumbled onto Ms. Zedde's novels some weeks back and I think this has to be her best novel. One reviewer describes her as dependable in the black lesbian community, so true.I loved ""Hungry for It"" and really liked the preceding novel to it, ""Taste of Sin"" but this one (one of her first I think), it has a certain level of maturity that I felt the others lacked. Can't really explain it; maybe because both main characters work full-time jobs, maybe it's their ages. But the dialog was so mature and witty. Sexy as hell to me. Additionally, I loved the setting! I can relate to it.Great character development. Fell in love with Hunter. I think we all did though. I liked Sinclair's dad too. Too often we get the non-existent, ghost of a male, in these novels. I also love that the black women in her novels are BLACK. Not black women trying to be white. I can't fully explain what I mean without getting into an essay but I think Ms. Zedde is aware of this in the black culture and is trying to find a balance. This is good.It's hard for me to find books that I can relate to on all levels. I'm encouraged when I can read about an intelligent black woman being successful, loving herself and falling in love with another intelligent black woman.Overall a 5/5 and definitely my favorite black lesbian novel at the moment.

Black Athena Revisited,"Was Western civilization founded by ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians? Can the ancient Egyptians usefully be called black? Did the ancient Greeks borrow religion, science, and philosophy from the Egyptians and Phoenicians? Have scholars ignored the Afroasiatic roots of Western civilization as a result of racism and anti-Semitism? In this collection of twenty essays, leading scholars in a broad range of disciplines confront the claims made by Martin Bernal in Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization. In that work, Bernal proposed a radical reinterpretation of the roots of classical civilization, contending that ancient Greek culture derived from Egypt and Phoenicia and that European scholars have been biased against the notion of Egyptian and Phoenician influence on Western civilization. The contributors to this volume argue that Bernal's claims are exaggerated and in many cases unjustified. Topics covered include race and physical anthropology; the question of an Egyptian invasion of Greece; the origins of Greek language, philosophy, and science; and racism and anti-Semitism in classical scholarship. In the conclusion to the volume, the editors propose an entirely new scholarly framework for understanding the relationship between the cultures of the ancient Near East and Greece and the origins of Western civilization.

M. LefkowitzClassics & Civilization:Do we study ancient cultures because, to some extent, all cultures share certain aspects? Does our Western culture reflect aspects of these other cultures? The answer to the first of the two questions has historically been found in a discussion of universality. The problem with the second question lies in its formulation. What is a culture after all?Classics, a seemingly outdated domain, is defined, by Wikipedia as the study of the language, literature, history, and art of the ancient world, around the Mediterranean; especially of Greece and Rome during classical antiquity. Classics; a plural noun refers generally to texts of the ancient Mediterranean, whose study constituted the main body of the humanities and still of importance in that domain of learning today.The case against Bernal:In 'The case against Martin Bernal,' David Gress, a Danish who has further identified the campus debates as a target, with an attack on Afrocentrism, alleging that, ""the political purpose of Black Athena is, of course, to lessen European cultural arrogance."" Apart from the fact that this charge has become a straw man--the chief problem in the academy today isn't European cultural arrogance but its opposite-- Bernal's account, and the political circumstances in which it appears, raise some important questions about scholarship and propaganda in the academy and, a fortiori, in what remains of the general culture.""Ms Lefkowitz knows better:Mary Lefkowitz, who received her Ph.D. in Classical Philology at Radcliffe College almost half a century ago (46 years) struggled to explain, ""...why some popular modern mythologies of the ancient world appear to have been created, and why they are mythologies rather than history. Also I ... attempt to show why it was that ancient writers like Herodotus and Diodorus claimed (mistakenly) that some aspects of Greek culture derived from Egypt, whereas such evidence as we have, suggests that the customs they regard as Egyptian in origin were either indigenous, or derived from other sources;..."" she attacked the established belief in an Egyptian Mystery System, institutions or initiation ritual, which could have inspired similar Greek traditions, the ultimate source of its thought systems; Greek philosophy.Black Athena Revisited:A collection of twenty essays in scholarly response to Bernal's first two volumes of Black Athena, a testament to the impact of Bernal's multi colored coat of scholarship, that so many contributors have combined their expertise to review the work of scholarship of the ancient Mediterranean world. Some were already published as book reviews; while the rest were written for this united front against Afrocentrism. Introduced by Mary Lefkowitz and concluded by Guy Rogers, the eighteen papers in between were written by American, English and an Italian expert, in Egyptology, Racism, with Orientalists, Linguistics, a science historian, Hellenists, and Historiographers. This wide front of contributors to 'Black Athena Revisited,' from a diverse range of related academic fields are united to confront the admirable Bernal trying to discredit his talented interpretation of any dark, let alone a Black Athena. Black Athena Revisited is a stimulating collective response, offering a variety of critical essays by experts from a diversity of disciplines covering Bernal's main hypotheses. Although mostly all papers extend attacks on Bernal and while rejecting his methodology, vary in tone from a polemical to critical, a couple come across as almost approaching character assassination.Toby Wilkinson, of Christ's College, Cambridge wrote, ""..no other book on the ancient world has created as much of a storm as Martin Bernal's Black Athena. Since the publication of the first volume in 1987, nearly seventy reviews, articles and films have appeared discussing the book, its goals, methods and hypotheses. Responses to Bernal's second volume, published 1991, have added to the enormous literature surrounding the work.""Baines Contra Bernal:John Baines offers an Egyptologist criticism of Bernal's thesis and methodology in his paper, 'On the Aims and Methods of Black Athena,' expressing serious reservations on the limited use of the Egyptological evidence in support of Egypt's contribution to the development of Greek civilization. He states his criticism that, 'Bernal's reluctance to engage with ancient Near Eastern civilizations on their own terms leads to bizarre interpretations.' Another Egyptologist, David O'Connor, no less critical in Bernal's conclusions, debates in a more conciliatory tone. 'Egypt and Greece: The Bronze Age Evidence' targets the textual evidence for Egypt's relations with the Levant during its Middle and New Kingdoms.In 'Black Athena: An Egyptological Review,' Yurco provides a rather detailed evaluation of the Egyptian evidence, downplaying the role of Mesopotamian influences in the formation of Greek civilization, in accordance with recent Egyptological consensus. The Meet Rahina inscription 'does attest an Egyptian-ruled Asiatic empire' contradicts O'Connor interpretation and accepts more of Bernal's arguments, for Egyptian influence on the Greeks as 'in essence reasonable.'Experts' Opinions:""Howe, an 'anti-Afrocentrist' by his own definition, is not taken with Lefkowitz's work. The distances which separate him from Lefkowitz, however, are minimized by the historiographic and epistemological issues the two embrace. Both are concerned with who has the right?, who is privileged, to participate in the construction of both history and knowledge?"" If this seems to be an argument only supported by classicists, Afrocentrists, and their critics, the questions involved in the privileging of certain histories and constructions of knowledge should resonate for world historians when they consider Eric Wolf's title and its implications: Europe and the People Without History.",2014,en
Bomber,"An exploration of how technology and best intentions collide in the heat of war A New York Times Book Review Editors' Choice In The Bomber Mafia, Malcolm Gladwell weaves together the stories of a Dutch genius and his homemade computer, a band of brothers in central Alabama, a British psychopath, and pyromaniacal chemists at Harvard to examine one of the greatest moral challenges in modern American history. Most military thinkers in the years leading up to World War II saw the airplane as an afterthought. But a small band of idealistic strategists, the ""Bomber Mafia,"" asked: What if precision bombing could cripple the enemy and make war far less lethal? In contrast, the bombing of Tokyo on the deadliest night of the war was the brainchild of General Curtis LeMay, whose brutal pragmatism and scorched-earth tactics in Japan cost thousands of civilian lives, but may have spared even more by averting a planned US invasion. In The Bomber Mafia, Gladwell asks, ""Was it worth it?"" Things might have gone differently had LeMay's predecessor, General Haywood Hansell, remained in charge. Hansell believed in precision bombing, but when he and Curtis LeMay squared off for a leadership handover in the jungles of Guam, LeMay emerged victorious, leading to the darkest night of World War II.

Disastrous environmental consequences ensued: a giant tsunami, continent-scale wildfires, darkness, and cold, followed by sweltering greenhouse heat. When conditions returned to normal, half the plant and animal genera on Earth had perished. This horrific chain of events is now widely accepted as the solution to a great scientific mystery: what caused the extinction of the dinosaurs? Walter Alvarez, one of the Berkeley scientists who discovered evidence of the impact, tells the story behind the development of the initially controversial theory. It is a saga of high adventure in remote locations, of arduous data collection and intellectual struggle, of long periods of frustration ended by sudden breakthroughs, of friendships made and lost, and of the exhilaration of discovery that forever altered our understanding of Earth's geological history.",['Walter Alvarez'],Princeton University Press,2015-09-15,['Science'],0375702105,A2FWEZ0QS8N7A7,0/0,4.0,1242172800,"His Side of the Story, Well Argued","This is a book for laymen and more power to Walter Alvarez for that. He tells a natural history detective story and is not compelled to gloss over those wrong turns that his own research pursued. The science is easy to swallow, too easy for some, but my own view is that any writing that draws people into science is good writing. Alvarez is also, refreshingly, respectful of those who disagree with his view that an impact event 65 million years ago killed off all the non-avian dinosaurs. I am among them -- largely thanks to him, no one reasonably can dispute an impact event that was disastrous for life at the KT boundary. But to argue, as Alvarez does, that up until that moment of impact, things were well and still thriving in dino world does not necesarily follow. This is a useful contribution to the debate about what happened to dinosaurs. But it was not the final word when it was published in 1997 and it is not today. One last tantalizing thought -- he touches on evidence that other great extinctions may have been impact extinctions and that there is at least some evidence of predictable periodicity to killing impacts. I'd like to know where that teaser evidence has led.",2015,en

The Moonstone (Young Readers' Lifetime Library Edition),"One of the great Victorian novels, The Moonstone has engrossed, entertained and enraptured readers since its first publication in 1868.

Part of the Macmillan Collector’s Library; a series of stunning, clothbound, pocket-sized classics with gold foiled edges and ribbon markers. These beautiful books make perfect gifts or a treat for any book lover. Lady Verinder’s uncle gives her the Moonstone – a magnificent diamond as large as an egg – for her eighteenth birthday, but it is not quite the generous gift it first seems. For he obtained it through bloody and nefarious means in India, and legend says the diamond’s guardians will stop at nothing to get it back.

After reading The Moonstone, and giving it five stars, I think I was correct in my estimation of TWIW. In spite of the excellent plotting and some well-drawn characterizations, TWIW is intended as a sensation novel, just that and not much more.The Moonstone, on the other hand, is a many-layered delight: satire, social commentary, well-plotted mystery, wonderful humor (that is never over-the-top, as it is in TWIW), delicious characterizations -- and serialization ending points that are suspenseful without being obviously contrived.As in TWIW, the characters unfold the story in their own narrative, revealing their own individual personalities in the process, but this device of the author's was obvious in its contrivance in TWIW; in The Moonstone the device is far more subtle. The ""skeleton"" of the story is boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy marries girl -- just as in TWIW -- but this basic story line is fleshed out masterfully, with a plot that includes Hindus sworn to recover a diamond stolen from a religious statue, a villain successfully masquerading as a humanitarian, narrow escapes for the hero (and a narrow escape for the heroine, as well), and oodles of coincidences skillfully presented so that the reader's willing suspension of disbelief is not disturbed.This is a book to be savored. Do not rush through it to uncover the answers to the mysteries -- although the temptation is great -- but enjoy the author's skill in plotting and the vivid characters he has created. Keep reminding yourself that this book first came out in installments, and readers had to wait from the suspenseful end of one installment until the next installment appeared, possibly providing some explanations.I don't intend to re-read TWIW -- I know the plot, and though some characters are worth revisiting it isn't worth my time to plow through 600 plus pages to do so. I will, however, re-read The Moonstone, for the enjoyment I get from the author's skill.",2018,en

It looks great on paper but is impossible to live out consistently.Howard proposes a different model. God is the central priority. Then, there are the other various priorities all connected to God.

Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill),"In a timely update of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, National Book Award finalist Ibi Zoboi skillfully balances cultural identity, class, and gentrification against the heady magic of first love in her vibrant reimagining of this beloved classic. A smart, funny, gorgeous retelling starring all characters of color. Zuri Benitez has pride. Brooklyn pride, family pride, and pride in her Afro-Latino roots. But pride might not be enough to save her rapidly gentrifying neighborhood from becoming unrecognizable. When the wealthy Darcy family moves in across the street, Zuri wants nothing to do with their two teenage sons, even as her older sister, Janae, starts to fall for the charming Ainsley. She especially can’t stand the judgmental and arrogant Darius. Yet as Zuri and Darius are forced to find common ground, their initial dislike shifts into an unexpected understanding. But with four wild sisters pulling her in different directions, cute boy Warren vying for her attention, and college applications hovering on the horizon, Zuri fights to find her place in Bushwick’s changing landscape, or lose it all. ""Zoboi skillfully depicts the vicissitudes of teenage relationships, and Zuri’s outsize pride and poetic sensibility make her a sympathetic teenager in a contemporary story about race, gentrification, and young love.""

The same can be said for the media, whose recent over-use of its famous opening line, `It is a truth universally acknowledged...' can be found repeated in the opening of many a news, magazine or blog article announcing some creditable or dubious connection to Jane Austen's characters or plot. Interestingly, it has become the meme of the day passed along and re-used by those who want to appear in the know, but are sadly missing the point. It is debatable if Pride and Prejudice's profound truths can be reduced to just universally acknowledged one-liners. If the novel was that easy to figure out we would not care two figs about it, and after nearly two hundred years, it would have been lost to obscurity! What one can expect though is so much more; an engaging plot that keeps you thinking and re-evaluating characters every step along the way, witty, sharp and humorous dialogue that others wish to emulate but never quite achieve, and a love story which just might reign supreme for all eternity. With all of these expectations before us, who could not be a little intimidated?The Oxford World's Classics new edition of Pride and Prejudice might just meet your need to read and explore Jane Austen's classic novel. This edition presents the reader with a wide variety of supplementary material to help you along in your discovery of the universal truths in Pride ad Prejudice. Like many editions, it supplies us with an unabridged text that has been carefully edited by prominent scholars since it was first published in 1813. `Carefully' is the operative word here, since the debate is on about what has been changed or removed from the text. I will again defer to my learned co-reviewer Prof. Moody to delve into that arena. In addition to the brief biography of Jane Austen, select bibliography, chronology of her life, and two appendixes on dancing and social status that are repeated in each of the six editions in this series, (and previously mentioned in our first review), this volume includes a twenty-six page introduction by Fiona Stafford, notes on the text including a publishing history, textural notes and explanatory notes unique to this edition filled with insights and facts neatly organized and easy to find.Writing an introduction to one of the most beloved and highly scrutinized novels in English literature is a daunting task indeed. My sympathies went out to Fiona Stafford even before I had read one word. Pride and Prejudice is so many things to different people, and not everyone's pet project could be addressed within the limit of space. I just hoped that she might enlighten me in some small way about a truth or insight that I had previously missed. She did not. But like one of the main themes in Pride and Prejudice, accounts by different people of the same events can have different truths. We all judge by our own unique agenda, so what I saw as lacking, another reader might find diverting. She did however, hit upon some interesting points; how the strength of our convictions can cloud our belief and disbeliefs, the divergence and attraction of different personalities, and how truth or the misconception of it can alter our judgment and future happiness.The truth may be uncertain in Pride and Prejudice, but on this fact I am convinced. I had difficultly writing about this introduction even after taking copious notes. This can be a telling sign to its clarity and content. I did however find one point of amusement when the author mentioned that characters can be distinguished by their speech patterns and gave examples; ""Lydia's use of `Oh Lord', Miss Bingley's `Abominable', Mr. Collins' `Lady Catherine de Bourgh', and Mary Bennet's lengthy, but largely content-free sentences distinguish her from her vivacious sisters."" This is definitely true of Austen's unique characterizations, but this introductions `content-free sentences' certainly distinguished it from any other vivacious introduction that this writer has the pleasure to read.Besides my disappointment in the introduction, the remainder of the supplemental material including the very helpful explanatory notes and the extensive chronology were a delight. For the new student the additional material is a must to understand the full context of the novel; - and for those Janeites who are ready to start your annual re-reading of Pride and Prejudice, pick up this edition. It is a perfect size to stash in your handbag or brief case, and whip out when the next debate ensues about whether Mr. Darcy was too proud, or just shy.",2018,en

This book covers a wide range of subjects including the psychology of survival, unique and fascinating ways of obtaining food and water, shelter-building, fire-building, navigation and a lot more.I will say that the book assumes the reader is encountering a ""survival situation"". By that, I mean a 'short-lived' situation in which survival is at stake. Those who buy this book with the intention of learning to live off the land in a more permanent way may be a little disappointed in some way. Indeed, this was the reason that I got the book but that's not to say that I regret buying it. Far from it! As I said, it has a lot of good information (it was made by the US Army after-all).Inside this manual is the US Army's Illustrated Guide to Edible Wild Plants which is also published in an entire book on its own, so if you planned on getting the two like I did, just get FM 21-76 and save yourself some money.My recommendation on learning survival skills is to acquire a variety of books.

Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library),"In a timely update of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, National Book Award finalist Ibi Zoboi skillfully balances cultural identity, class, and gentrification against the heady magic of first love in her vibrant reimagining of this beloved classic. A smart, funny, gorgeous retelling starring all characters of color. Zuri Benitez has pride. Brooklyn pride, family pride, and pride in her Afro-Latino roots. But pride might not be enough to save her rapidly gentrifying neighborhood from becoming unrecognizable. When the wealthy Darcy family moves in across the street, Zuri wants nothing to do with their two teenage sons, even as her older sister, Janae, starts to fall for the charming Ainsley. She especially can’t stand the judgmental and arrogant Darius. Yet as Zuri and Darius are forced to find common ground, their initial dislike shifts into an unexpected understanding. But with four wild sisters pulling her in different directions, cute boy Warren vying for her attention, and college applications hovering on the horizon, Zuri fights to find her place in Bushwick’s changing landscape, or lose it all. ""Zoboi skillfully depicts the vicissitudes of teenage relationships, and Zuri’s outsize pride and poetic sensibility make her a sympathetic teenager in a contemporary story about race, gentrification, and young love.""

Gone with the Wind,"'My dear, I don't give a damn.' Margaret Mitchell’s page-turning, sweeping American epic has been a classic for over eighty years. Beloved and thought by many to be the greatest of the American novels, Gone with the Wind is a story of love, hope and loss set against the tense historical background of the American Civil War. The lovers at the novel’s centre – the selfish, privileged Scarlett O’Hara and rakish Rhett Butler – are magnetic: pulling readers into the tangled narrative of a struggle to survive that cannot be forgotten. WINNER OF NATIONAL BOOK AWARD AND PULITZER PRIZE 'For sheer readability I can think of nothing it must give way before' The New Yorker 'What makes some people come through catastrophes and others, apparently just as able, strong, and brave, go under?’ Margaret Mitchell",['Margaret Mitchell'],Random House,2020-01-02,['Fiction'],0446781819,A1FW37K0DKH5M9,0/8,3.0,1337472000,"Let's keep things in perspective, folks","Margaret Mitchel wrote only one book in her life. ""Gone With The Wind"" not only won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1935, but the film version won Best Picture in 1939 - opposite ""The Wizard of Oz"". Mitchel never wrote again, though in the mid 1940's she was struck by an automobile on Peachtree Street in Atlanta and her body was dragged for more than 100 feet.Her fiuneral was more majestic than Scarlet and Rhett's wedding.a signed first edition of this book today is worth well over $15,000.As for the new introduction written by Pulitzer Prize winner, Pat Conroy (""The Prince of Tides"") He is, after all a Southern Writer and his own material is considered literature. I'll leave his words up to you. I respect his work a great deal. Even if not his opinion. And that's all an intorduction or a review is; a critic attempts to establish crredability with words. and in seeking out a Soutern Writer, though there are dozens of well qualified women writers (Lett's, Flagg, Kingsolver) With Styron, Clemens and Faulkner gone we are left with Conroy and John Grisham. I'd be interested to know what all of these people would write in an introduction.""Gone With The Wind"" is a terrific story, fairly well written and highly emotional. It is one of the few war novels in history written from a woman;s perspective (that includes battle scene action) and the character of Scarlet O'Hara- our protaganist and ingenue - has become an adjective in describing other characters. In some ways, this novel; is a huge step forward for the feminist movement, but far more so it set the civil rights movement back subsgtantially and continues to every single time someone reads it. People read that book and actually believe that slaves were treated like family members. Mitchell writes about Mammy and Poke and Prissy passing along the perfumed hearsay her grandmother told her that the ""houise darkys"" are given ""family status"" but still Scarlett's frustration over Prissy's idlesness causes her to threaaten to break a switch acorss her back. Miss Scarlet runs into Big Sam as the Confederate Army leaves Atlanta to the Yankees while Scarlet must stay to bring Melly's baby (A love promise she made to Melly's husband)He is a Field Hand but she speaks with him because he is an overseer and only becausee the Yankee's canons and guns can be heard on the hprizon. She gaters information and does not wish him well;she will never see him again and as readers we never hear of him again. Neither the book nor the film do anything to expose what slavery was and the way in which ""Gone With The Wind"" has injured the rights for descendents of America-slaves is sinceely nauseating.There are millions who would break a switch across my back for this review. I saw go to it,k but you'd better re-read thge book before you do it. Perhaps watch the film as well, as it is less harsh than the book. (I own the screenplay)So by all means, everyone should read ""Gone With The Wind"". The more controlversial, the more one should read. But before you do, read Alice Walker's ""The Color Purple"" which also won the Pulitzer Prize. I've taught these books together as WAlker's also takes place in the South in 1935 and gives a clear idea of what life was like for the once-slaved,now impoverished. Thern read GWTW. After you get all teary and warm with ""Gone With The Wind""(and you will be) then you must read William Styron's ""The Confessions of Nat Turner"", also a Pulitzer Prize winner, which was written in 1966, utilizerd what little is known of the trial of Nat Turner and tells us more truth about what it was to be a slave. If after that you still haven't gotten the picture pick up the recently published book about Paul Jennings, ""A Slave in The White House""- the book that first speaks of a black man in the oval office, only he was dusting it, pouring drinks for President Madfison and he was, in truth, the one who rescued the lifesized portrait of George Washington. (Dolley Madison was a selfish, nasty woman who became frighened of her 104 slaves after President Madison died; oit is a fact, that during her lifetime at Montpieler after James died, Nat Turner's revolt occured and in New England the ship ""Amistad"" was overturned. For so many of us, fiction is a way to step into the minds and souls of another person in another world. With ""Gone With The Wind"" you run the risk of emerging a bigot.",2020,en

River of the Brokenhearted,"From David Adams Richards, winner of the Giller Prize and the Governor General’s Award, comes a magnificent and haunting novel about the entwinement of remembered love and unforgotten hate. Spanning generations, River of the Brokenhearted tells the life and legacy of Janie McCleary, a strong-willed Irish Catholic girl who dares to marry a man from the Church of England. Their union is quickly deemed scandalous, and when her husband dies young, just before the Great Depression, Janie is left alone to raise a family and run a business—the first movie theater in town. Through the strength of her character, she succeeds in a world of men. For that she is ostracized and becomes a victim of double-dealing and overt violence. Based on the author’s own grandmother, Janie is a pioneer before the age of feminism, but her salty individualism burdens the lives of her children and grandchildren. Writing with compassion and mastery, Richards muses on the tyranny of memory and history, and peers into the hearts of extraordinary characters. There he finds an alchemy of venality and goodwill, deceit and brotherliness, marked cruelty and true love. Once again, David Adams Richards has brought us a work of astonishing grace, rooted in his special territory on the great river Miramichi of New Brunswick, but firmly universal in scope. Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade, Yucca, and Good Books imprints, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in fiction—novels, novellas, political and medical thrillers, comedy, satire, historical fiction, romance, erotic and love stories, mystery, classic literature, folklore and mythology, literary classics including Shakespeare, Dumas, Wilde, Cather, and much more.

She claimed she killed six more victims before authorities finally locked her behind bars. Award-winning journalist Sue Russell updates her harrowing and definitive real-life thriller with new details of the most famous female serial killer's decade on death row, her execution in 2002--and the lasting impact of her dark deeds. The case that inspired the Academy Awarding-winning movie Monster ""A riveting and fascinating tale."" --Robert Scott With 16 Pages Of Photos",['Sue Russell'],Pinnacle Books,2013-04-12,['True Crime'],0786015187,A7QQ4PXIWZVO0,10/11,5.0,1084147200,Great Crime Story - And Still Objective,"&amp;#65279; Lethal Intent by Sue Russell is true crime writing at its best. It should be the companion piece for the 2003 film Monster starring Oscar winning actress Charlize Theron. If you already are drawn to true crime writing, this work holds its own against many true crime books of the recent half century. Add Ms. Russell's account of Aileen Wuornos to Vincent Bugliosi's account of Charles Manson; Jess Walter's account of the siege at Ruby Ridge; Gerald Posner's books on the assassinations of JFK and Martin Luther King; and Stephen Singular's account of the murder of Alan Berg, to name a few.If you were drawn into the film ""Monster"", you owe it to yourself to read about Wuornos' background (hereditary or environment?); her inability to a hold a person's socialinterest in her for more than 15 minutes; the possible catalyst that triggered her shooting spree; and the detective work that stopped the killing. The trial was virtually ignored in the film, but Ms. Russell's narrative shows how it became a three-ring circus. Finally, you can square the movie's portrayal of the circumstances of the murders with actual interrogations and testimonies which effectively remove the romanticism away from this treacherous murderer.I disagree with one of the reviewers' claims that the book is ""very very biased"" and that Ms. Russell ""hated"" her subject. I think the fact that Ms Russell provides possible sociological and genetic explanations without absolving the murderer of her crimes actually shows some sympathy for the killer without falling under the delusion that justice would have been better served if Wuornos were acquitted because her behavior, after all, was someone else's fault.",2013,en
Everything Is Illuminated : A Novel,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER. Jonathan Safran Foer's debut—""a funny, moving...deeply felt novel about the dangers of confronting the past and the redemption that comes with laughing at it, even when that seems all but impossible."" (Time) With only a yellowing photograph in hand, a young man—also named Jonathan Safran Foer—sets out to find the woman who might or might not have saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Accompanied by an old man haunted by memories of the war, an amorous dog named Sammy Davis, Junior, Junior, and the unforgettable Alex, a young Ukrainian translator who speaks in a sublimely butchered English, Jonathan is led on a quixotic journey over a devastated landscape and into an unexpected past. As their adventure unfolds, Jonathan imagines the history of his grandfather’s village, conjuring a magical fable of startling symmetries that unite generations across time. As his search moves back in time, the fantastical history moves forward, until reality collides with fiction in a heart-stopping scene of extraordinary power. “Imagine a novel as verbally cunning as A Clockwork Orange, as harrowing as The Painted Bird, as exuberant and twee as Candide, and you have Everything Is Illuminated . . .

Tales from the White Hart,"A compendium of science fiction stories filled with “high diversion, amusement and amazement” from the legendary creator of 2001: A Space Odyssey (Los Angeles Times). In the White Hart Pub in London just north of Fleet Street, Harry Purvis holds court with his fellow writers of scientific yarns. A consummate storyteller, Harry is joined by the actual writers Samuel Youd, John Wyndham, and Clarke himself, all under pseudonyms, and all trying to outdo each other with their outlandish tales of science and invention.

Crazy for You,"A psychologist and bestselling author redefines love and sex addiction as a spectrum disorder, and offers a new approach for healing. For anyone who has wondered Why does everyone else seem to be able to make romantic relationships work, and I can’t? What’s wrong with me? Why is love so hard? Psychologist and bestselling memoirist Kerry Cohen is all too familiar with the questions she often hears from her clients—and has asked herself. Even though sex and love are some of the most universal, sought-after experiences we have, many of us lack the tools and understanding to approach them in a healthy way. Without knowing it, many people struggling with sex and love actually fall somewhere on the spectrum of sex and love addiction (SLA). Sex and love addiction is still wildly misunderstood. It’s shrouded in secrecy and shame, and many counselors lack the training to address it—leaving people who need help without resources. Yet SLA isn’t a binary of you are or you aren’t, rather, it’s a spectrum. Kerry Cohen knows this all too well as both a therapist and someone who identifies on the SLA spectrum. Based on research and her own clinical experience, Crazy for You dives into SLA and provides an inclusive framework for understanding relationships, along with practical exercises and advice for self-assessment, discovery, and healing: Part one explains the sex and love addiction spectrum, helping you determine where you fall on it and how you got there Part two introduces strategies for breaking the spell of sex and love addiction, like behavior modifications and self-awareness techniques Part three teaches you how to navigate healthy, safe, and fulfilling relationships",['Kerry Cohen'],Hachette UK,2021-09-21,['Self-Help'],0330426478,A373G0BH0VXQMW,0/0,5.0,981244800,And You Thought Small Town Life Was Dull?!,"Quinn McKenzie teaches art in Tibbets H.S. and lives with the popular baseball/football coach, Bill Hilliard, the nicest guy in town.

I worshipped Darren Stevens the First. When he'd come home from work and Samantha would say, ‘Darren, would you like me to fix you a drink?' He'd always rest his briefcase on the table below the mirror in the foyer, wipe his forehead with a monogrammed handkerchief and say, ‘Better make it a double.'""

You've seen him on the street, in bars, on the subway, at restaurants: a twentysomething guy, nice suit, works in advertising. Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had two drinks, Augusten was circling the drain by having twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. Loud, distracting ties, automated wake-up calls and cologne on the tongue could only hide so much for so long. At the request (well, it wasn't really a request) of his employers, Augusten lands in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey Jr. are immediately dashed by grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers.

The Greek Myths,"The gold standard in Greek mythology, in a dazzling Graphic Deluxe Edition with a new introduction by the bestselling author of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series From the creation of the world out of Chaos and the birth of the Olympians to the Trojan War and Odysseus's return, Robert Graves's superb retelling of the Greek myths has long been acclaimed as the definitive edition. Graves draws on sources scattered throughout ancient literature, using a novelist's skill to weave a crisp, coherent narrative of each myth and providing commentaries with cross-references, interpretations, and explanations based on solid scholarship. The result is a classic volume of many of the greatest stories ever told—stories of the gods, heroes, and extraordinary events that inspired Homer, the Greek tragedians, and so much of subsequent European literature.

The book provides compiled summaries for each main Greek hero and deity. Graves then provides his own evaluation as to the anthropological origins of the myths in the context of early Greek civilization. His focus is primarily on Minoan and pre-Mycenean civilizations.Through etymology and historical analysis, Graves contends that Greek mythology is a compilation of two distinct religious practices that were later merged. Graves argues that cults for female godesses such Hera, Diane, Athena, Hecate, etc., were the product of early Greek matriarchal/amazonian societies. Graves argues that myths such as the castration of Kronos and the labors of Herakles refer to the practice of mock-kings who were used for ceremony in fertility rituals. Such mock-kings, Graves recites, were sacrificed at the end of the ritual by the Amazon Queen. Graves suggests that the traditional patriarchal triad of Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon was introduced later when the Myceneans invaded Greece and conquered these matriarchies.Overall, the book offers a direction of study that would be useful in corroborating a facinating theory about societies in Ancient Greece and how their evolution was presented through mythology. Unfortunately, as is usual with virtually an myth, the reason events usually become mythical is because there were few hard facts left behind to corroborate the truth that lies behind them.",2012,en
Scars of Evolution,"In this lively and controversial book Elaine Morgan presents a challenging interpretation to the question of human evolution. With brilliant logic she argues that our hominid ancestors began to evolve in response to an aquatic environment. Millions of years ago something happened that caused our ancestors to walk on two legs, to lose their fur, to develop larger brains and learn how to speak. Elaine Morgan discovers what this event was by studying the many incongruous flaws in the physiological make-up of humans. The human body is liable to suffer from obesity, lower back pain and acne. In support of her aquatic ape hypothesis she points out the flaws in our physiological make-up: the difficulties of erect bipedalism, our hairlessness and fat-layers, our preference for face to face sex and the way we breathe. Are these flaws a record of the history of the species, the 'scars' of evolution that are clues to earlier stages of evolution? Morgan establishes the origins of the evolutionary path that separated humans from other animals and questions the theories currently accepted by science. Did our ancestors adapt to an aquatic environment that subsequently dried out? Elaine Morgan has made the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis a plausible alternative to conventional theories of evolution and in The Scars of Evolution she brings a real understanding of who humans are and where they came from.",['Elaine Morgan'],Souvenir Press,2012-04-01,['Science'],B000J2L94K,AVJXDVS695790,0/0,5.0,1348272000,The scars of evolution.

"The Judgment of Paris: Manet, Meissonier and the Birth of Impressionism","The fascinating new book by the author of Brunelleschi’s Dome and Michelangelo and the Pope’s Ceiling: a saga of artistic rivalry and cultural upheaval in the decade leading to the birth of Impressionism. If there were two men who were absolutely central to artistic life in France in the second half of the nineteenth century, they were Edouard Manet and Ernest Meissonier. While the former has been labelled the “Father of Impressionism” and is today a household name, the latter has sunk into obscurity. It is difficult now to believe that in 1864, when this story begins, it was Meissonier who was considered the greatest French artist alive and who received astronomical sums for his work, while Manet was derided for his messy paintings of ordinary people and had great difficulty getting any of his work accepted at the all-important annual Paris Salon. Manet and Meissonier were the Mozart and Salieri of their day, one a dangerous challenge to the establishment, the other beloved by rulers and the public alike for his painstakingly meticulous oil paintings of historical subjects. Out of the fascinating story of their parallel careers, Ross King creates a lens through which to view the political tensions that dogged Louis-Napoleon during the Second Empire, his ignominious downfall, and the bloody Paris Commune of 1871. At the same time, King paints a wonderfully detailed and vivid portrait of life in an era of radical social change: on the streets of Paris, at the new seaside resorts of Boulogne and Trouville, and at the race courses and picnic spots where the new bourgeoisie relaxed. When Manet painted Dejeuner sur l’herbe or Olympia, he shocked not only with his casual brushstrokes (described by some as applied by a ‘floor mop’ ) but with his subject matter: top-hatted white-collar workers (and their mistresses) were not considered suitable subjects for ‘Art’. Ross King shows how, benign as they might seem today, these paintings changed the course of history. The struggle between Meissonier and Manet to see their paintings achieve pride of place at the Salon was not just about artistic competitiveness, it was about how to see the world. Full of fantastic tidbits of information (such as the use of carrier pigeons and hot-air balloons during the siege of Paris), and a colourful cast of characters that includes Baudelaire, Courbet, and Zola, with walk-on parts for Monet, Renoir, Degas, and Cezanne, The Judgment of Paris casts new light on the birth of Impressionism and takes us to the heart of a time in which the modern French identity was being forged.",['Ross King'],Anchor Canada,2012-01-11,['Art'],1593978774,AUP9LBWCLM2ZD,1/1,4.0,1189036800,Engaging Perspective,"This is good book on its own, but a great reference for those who wish to know more about the area. The is so much emphesis on the Impressionist Movement itself that there is very little information about the times and events that made the movement such a revolution.

And through his perceptive prose we learn that what matters most are the people he meets along the way, including the monologuing Mr. Thornberry in Costa Rica, the bogus priest of Cali, and the blind Jorge Luis Borges, who delights in having Theroux read Robert Louis Stevenson to him.",['Paul Theroux'],Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,2014-11-18,['Travel'],0671467409,A319KYEIAZ3SON,35/35,4.0,1150934400,"""The journey, not the arrival, matters; the voyage, not the landing.""","In 1979, Paul Theroux departed from his childhood home in Medford, Massachusetts, and began his train journey from the East Coast of the United States to Patagonia, on the southern tip of Argentina. A seasoned traveler, fluent in Spanish, Theroux brings to life his trip through the northern and southern hemispheres, traveling without a schedule and observing his fellow passengers on the train and people at stops along the way.In Texas he is astonished at the contrasts between Laredo on the Texas side of the Rio Grande and Nuevo Laredo across the border in Mexico, commenting on society and governments. Traveling through Mexico and Guatemala, he observes the poverty of the Indians and their lack of opportunities. In El Salvador he attends a soccer game and gets caught up in the melee and riots which follow it. In Costa Rica, the cleanest country he has visited, he finds himself stuck on the train with Mr. Thornberry, a New Hampshire tourist so boring that Theroux cannot wait to escape him--only to have Mr. Thornberry ""save his life"" by offering him a place to stay upon his arrival in Limon. In Panama he meets the ""Zonians,"" from the Canal Zone, and in Cali, Colombia, he meets a married ""priest"" who cannot tell his devout mother in Belfast that he has ""left"" the church to marry and have children.Throughout his trip, Theroux reads classics, particularly enjoying Boswell's Life of Dr. Johnson and Edgar Allen Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym, both of which provide ironic reference points for his own journey. For literature lovers, the most fascinating section occurs in Buenos Aires, where Theroux spends many days visiting blind writer Jorge Luis Borges, who persuades Theroux to read to him. Ironically, one of Borges's favorite novels is The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym. As Theroux takes notes on his meetings with Borges, he becomes Borges's Boswell.More an observer than a participant, Theroux has an unfortunate air of superiority about what he sees and hears. Sparing little sympathy for American and German tourists, he rarely gets excited about his surroundings, expressing genuine emotion only when he talks with three boys, ages ten to twelve, who live in a doorway and scavenge for food because their rural families have abandoned them. Theroux's self-congratulatory attitude gets a bit wearisome, but the picture of Central and South America, thirty years ago, and the section with Borges are unparalleled. With beautiful, carefully observed prose and a great ear for dialogue, Theroux's Patagonia Express is a landmark travel memoir. n Mary Whipple",2014,en

Fred Kaplan, hailed by The New York Times as “a rare combination of defense intellectual and pugnacious reporter,” takes us into the White House Situation Room, the Joint Chiefs of Staff’s “Tank” in the Pentagon, and the vast chambers of Strategic Command to bring us the untold stories—based on exclusive interviews and previously classified documents—of how America’s presidents and generals have thought about, threatened, broached, and just barely avoided nuclear war from the dawn of the atomic age until today.

"The new How I made $2,000,000 in the stock market","How I Made $2 million in the Stock Market is an extraordinary book. It tells one of the most unusual success stories in the history of the stock market. Darvas was not a stock market professional trading on inside information. He was one half of the highest paid dance team in show business, an expert cryptic crossword compiler, and a championship ping pong player. Yet he was able to make himself a millionaire several times over by his unique investment approach. Unlike other so-called systems, it worked regardless of whether the market rose or fell. When news of Darvas's fantastic profits and methods leaked out, he was featured in Time magazine. He then was persuaded to write a book which became an instant hit, selling nearly 200,000 copies in eight weeks. Many of the companies talked about in this book no longer exist. Many of the stocks are no longer traded. Nevertheless, the basic principles are as sound as ever.",['Nicholas Darvas'],Harriman House Limited,2011-05-24,['Business & Economics'],B0006C2SC0,APJNMA1FFM2VK,13/15,4.0,1183334400,He did it in a bull market,"Nicolas Darvas wrote a very entertaining book. Maybe the fact that I'm half Hungarian added to the vicarious enjoyment. His early misadventures touched a raw nerve. His remarks about the high cost of trading in the bad old days reminded me of why I switched to an online broker. While reading the book I broke out in laughter several times.I was so intrigued by the box model that I created a computer model to test it. The results were a disappointment. While I didn't test it with too many stocks, I ran the tests with growers like BLWD, AAPL, and CMG. Darvas stated that he invested in growth stocks even if he didn't call them that and I tried to mimic his style as closely as possible. To give an example, over a period of 18 month from Jan 2006 to June 2007, the model traded BWLD five times, two winners and three losers for a net gain of 11% over 18 months. Improving the stops might have increased the yield to around 16%. That's nothing to write home about. During that same period of time the Dow 30 advanced 16% (annualized percentages).Some seven years ago I played around with another computer model based on crossing the various DMA lines. The stocks I used were the tech darlings of the bubble era. I used real price data from the '90s. The model made Warren Buffet look like a rank amateur, it was producing yields well in excess of 50% and it generated a very concentrated portfolio even when I fed it data for over 100 stocks. When I tested the same model in a bear market scenario it came out even, losing the trade commissions.Why the long story? Because I'm trying to put Darvas' achievement in perspective. From Jan 1957 to Dec 1958 the Dow 30 yielded 24% annualized, about three times its long term average. Darvas used an enormous amount of leverage or margin, more than most of us can obtain today and certainly much more than I would ever be willing to risk. Darvas must have had very good income from his dancing to dare risk that much. He did keep is income and his investing funds separate. Darvas was also very astute in his stock picking. The Soviets launched Sputnik on October 4, 1957 and America was feverishly trying to catch up. Kennedy was a good speechmaker.I believe that an extraordinary number of favorable circumstances came together in a very fortuitous way to enable Darvas to achieve his feat. From $25K to $2.25M in two years is an annualized return of 843%. As they say on TV, ""Don't try this at home."" :)",2011,en

"The greengage summer,: A novel","A sixteen-year-old girl captures the dangerous attention of an older man in this New York Times–bestselling novel by the author of Black Narcissus. Soon after the end of the terrible Great War, Mrs. Grey brings her five young children to the French countryside for the summer in hopes of instilling in them a sense of history and humility. But when she is struck down by a sudden illness and hospitalized, the siblings are left to fend for themselves at the lovely, bullet-scarred hotel Les Oeillets, under the suspicious, watchful eyes of its owner, Mademoiselle Zizi. The young ones find a willing guide, companion, and protector in charming Englishman Eliot, a longtime resident at Les Oeillets and Mlle. Zizi’s apparent paramour. But as these warm days of freedom, discovery, and adolescent adventure unfold, Eliot’s interest becomes more and more focused on the eldest of the Grey children, sixteen-year-old daughter Joss. The older man’s obsession with the innocent, alluring, heartbreakingly beautiful woman-child soon threatens to overstep all bounds of propriety. And as Eliot’s fascination increases, so does the jealousy of his disrespected lover, adding fuel to a dangerously smoldering fire that could erupt into unexpected violence at any moment. Told from the point of view of Cecil, Joss’s sharp-eyed younger sister, The Greengage Summer is a beautiful, poignant, darkly tinged coming-of-age story rich in the sights, smells, and sounds of France’s breathtaking Champagne country.

Mangoes & Curry Leaves,"Under the Tuscan Sun meets the wide-open sea . . . An Embarrassment of Mangoes is a delicious chronicle of leaving the type-A lifestyle behind -- and discovering the seductive secrets of life in the Caribbean. Who hasn’t fantasized about chucking the job, saying goodbye to the rat race, and escaping to some exotic destination in search of sun, sand, and a different way of life? Canadians Ann Vanderhoof and her husband, Steve did just that. In the mid 1990s, they were driven, forty-something professionals who were desperate for a break from their deadline-dominated, career-defined lives. So they quit their jobs, rented out their house, moved onto a 42-foot sailboat called Receta (“recipe,” in Spanish), and set sail for the Caribbean on a two-year voyage of culinary and cultural discovery. In lavish detail that will have you packing your swimsuit and dashing for the airport, Vanderhoof describes the sun-drenched landscapes, enchanting characters and mouthwatering tastes that season their new lifestyle. Come along for the ride and be seduced by Caribbean rhythms as she and Steve sip rum with their island neighbors, hike lush rain forests, pull their supper out of the sea, and adapt to life on “island time.” Exchanging business clothes for bare feet, they drop anchor in 16 countries -- 47 individual islands -- where they explore secluded beaches and shop lively local markets. Along the way, Ann records the delectable dishes they encounter -- from cracked conch in the Bahamas to curried lobster in Grenada, from Dominican papaya salsa to classic West Indian rum punch -- and incorporates these enticing recipes into the text so that readers can participate in the adventure. Almost as good as making the journey itself, An Embarrassment of Mangoes is an intimate account that conjures all the irresistible beauty and bounty from the Bahamas to Trinidad -- and just may compel you to make a rash decision that will land you in paradise.",['Ann Vanderhoof'],Anchor Canada,2011-03-11,['Biography & Autobiography'],1579652522,A3OLSBN7LX9J4A,3/3,5.0,1201305600,"Excellent, Informative and Engaging Cookbook/Diary","Plain and simple,..a must-have book.

He had a realistic past, I identified with him a lot more than the main protagonist of ""He's the One,"" and moreover, he was just a wonderfully developed secondary character with some great stuff in his written past.Now I know why.Turns out that ""It Had to be You,"" is the story of Daniel Stephenson, getting up to just about the point where he's in in ""He's the One."" This was great, even if I did already know the ending as I'd read them out of order. Daniel is an easy-to-identify-with character for me (no buff jock, just a slim guy; no massively successful job, just an entry level second-attempt-at-a-career). He's still hurt over the betrayal of his last boyfriend, still a little damaged over the revelation that yet another friend is slowly dying of AIDS, and just about ripe for falling head over heels with the hunky guy across the street. Basically, he's a knight in slightly tarnished and dented armor (or at least a sequined gown).The trouble being that the guy across the street lives with a woman, seems about as straight as they come, and probably won't react well to Daniel's previous career as a female impersonator who mostly did Lady 2Di4, a Princess Diana tribute. Uh oh.The wit is just as sharp in this one as in ""He's the One,"" - and just as often nicely balanced with some poignancy that doesn't over-sweeten to saccharine levels.

Finnegan's Wake,"A daring work of experimental, Modernist genius, James Joyce's Finnegans Wake is one of the greatest literary achievements of the twentieth century, and the crowning glory of Joyce's life. The Penguin Modern Classics edition of includes an introduction by Seamus Deane 'riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs' Joyce's final work, Finnegan's Wake is his masterpiece of the night as Ulysses is of the day. Supreme linguistic virtuosity conjures up the dark underground worlds of sexuality and dream. Joyce undermines traditional storytelling and all official forms of English and confronts the different kinds of betrayal - cultural, political and sexual - that he saw at the heart of Irish history. Dazzlingly inventive, with passages of great lyrical beauty and humour, Finnegans Wake remains one of the most remarkable works of the twentieth century. James Joyce (1882-1941), the eldest of ten children, was born in Dublin, but exiled himself to Paris at twenty as a rebellion against his upbringing. He only returned to Ireland briefly from the continent but Dublin was at heart of his greatest works, Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. He lived in poverty until the last ten years of his life and was plagued by near blindness and the grief of his daughter's mental illness.

"Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West","From the New York Times bestselling author of Band of Brothers and D-Day, the definitive book on Lewis and Clark’s exploration of the Louisiana Purchase, the most momentous expedition in American history and one of the great adventure stories of all time. In 1803 President Thomas Jefferson selected his personal secretary, Captain Meriwether Lewis, to lead a voyage up the Missouri River to the Rockies, over the mountains, down the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean, and back. Lewis and his partner, Captain William Clark, made the first map of the trans-Mississippi West, provided invaluable scientific data on the flora and fauna of the Louisiana Purchase territory, and established the American claim to Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Ambrose has pieced together previously unknown information about weather, terrain, and medical knowledge at the time to provide a vivid backdrop for the expedition. Lewis is supported by a rich variety of colorful characters, first of all Jefferson himself, whose interest in exploring and acquiring the American West went back thirty years. Next comes Clark, a rugged frontiersman whose love for Lewis matched Jefferson’s. There are numerous Indian chiefs, and Sacagawea, the Indian girl who accompanied the expedition, along with the French-Indian hunter Drouillard, the great naturalists of Philadelphia, the French and Spanish fur traders of St. Louis, John Quincy Adams, and many more leading political, scientific, and military figures of the turn of the century.

Ambrose'],Simon and Schuster,2013-04-23,['History'],B000N7ASGQ,A37DTO57JS15PX,4/5,3.0,1268092800,A Little Disappointing,"Not long ago, I visited Oregon and some of the places where Lewis and Clark ended their journey across the continent, which made me want to read more about the expedition. All roads seemed to lead to this recent work from Stephen Ambrose, so I picked it up.I have to say that I was a little disappointed. First, it's as if Ambrose couldn't quite decide if he wanted to write a biography of Meriwether Lewis or a history of the Lewis and Clark expedition. The story of the expedition is couched within a proto-biography of Lewis' early and late life. There isn't enough there to really consider it a Lewis biography, and I think that the work would probably have been better if Ambrose had either left this material out, or greatly reduced it. Clark isn't profiled in this way, and Ambrose seems to lament in the introduction that someone has already beaten him to the punch with Clark.Second, the writing is very workmanlike. The writing isn't bad, but it's not great either. The narrative is very slow in the beginning, but picks up steam as the expedition actually gets underway; however, none of it was especially captivating to me.Third, Ambrose gets repetitious with ""firsts,"" some of which are of dubious validity. Fairly early in the expedition, Ambrose treats us to a series of ""Lewis and Clark were the first to do X"" statements about every third page. Some are undoubtedly true, but others--such as Lewis and Clark holding the first vote west of the Mississippi, or being the first Americans to see a coyote, despite over 10,000 Americans living in Missouri when Lewis Clark got there--are probably not true, or simply can't be known to be true.I was disappointed because I really wanted to like this book. I didn't dislike it, but it's completely average. I've read several other books by Ambrose, and this was disappointing by that standard. Ambrose wasn't necessarily a great writer of history, but he was a great popularizer of history, which is certainly important.

After he is captured and taken to Camelot, he is put before the knights of King Arthur’s Round Table where he is condemned to death. However, he remembers having read of an eclipse on the day of his execution and he astonishes the court by predicting the phenomenon.

Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban,"Through classroom activities, wizard rock concerts, and organizations like the Harry Potter Alliance, Harry Potter fans are using creativity to positively impact the world. This collection of essays and interviews examines how playful fandom--from fanfiction to Muggle quidditch, cosplay, role-playing games, and even Harry Potter burlesque--not only reimagines the canon but also challenges consumerism, questions notions of identity, and fosters participatory culture. The contributors explore issues applicable to fan studies and performance studies at large, such as the role of performance, the nature of community, and questions of representation and ownership in the digital age. Presented in three parts, the essays discuss discrepancies between sanctioned versions of Harry Potter and fan creations, the reenactment and reinterpretation of the original narrative in fan performance, and collaborative and participatory performances that break down the boundaries between actors and audiences.",['Lisa S.

K. Rowling""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is personally one of my least favorite Harry books, but even so, I still enjoy rereading it every so often. This book sets a lot of groundwork for the following books in the series, and is also a pretty good story.Harry and his friends are back for their third year at Hogwarts, but this year the entire wizarding world is alert and searching for an escaped murderer, Sirius Black. The Ministry of Magic and Dumbledore believe Black may be after Harry, so dementors, horrifically spooky, soulless beasts, guard the school. Black is believed to be responsible for murdering 13 people with a single curse; before he escaped the wizard prison of Azkaban, he was heard to murmur ""he's at Hogwarts"" in his sleep.While other students feel merely miserable when near dementors, Harry feels far worse, and can hear his parents being killed by Voldemort. He begs Professor Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, to show him how to ward off the dementors. Lupin is the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Harry and his friends have had yet; he often brings creatures to class and shows them how to defend or attack as necessary. Lupin is one of my favorite characters in the series - I would've loved to learn from him!With Sirius Black free, and the Quidditch cup up for grabs, it's no surprise that Harry has a busy, busy year. As I said above, there are a lot of characters and details introduced in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" that become important as you read further in the series. The book does seem a little overly long, but Rowling does pack it full of her mix of great fantasy and action.4/5.",2015,en

Night And Day (Classic Books on Cassettes Collection) [UNABRIDGED],"In his life and in his music, Cole Porter was the top—the pinnacle of wit and sophistication. From the 1910s through the ‘50s, from Yale pep rallies through the Broadway triumphs of Anything Goes and Kiss Me, Kate, he delighted audiences with a glittering torrent of song: “I Get a Kick Out of You.” “Night and Day,” “Love for Sale,” and “Just One of Those Things.” The bright surface of these gems—their catchy melodies and ingenious lyrics—made them instant pop hits. Their more subtle qualities and their musical and emotional depth have made them lasting standards, among the greatest glories of the American songbook. In Cole Porter, William McBrien has thoroughly captured the creator of these songs, whose life was one not only of wealth and privilege but also of tragedy, secrecy, and courage. A prodigal young man, Porter found his aesthetic and emotional anchor in a long, loving, if sexless marriage, while continuing to maintain many discreet affairs with men. In 1937, at the height of his success, he suffered a near-fatal riding accident; his last eighteen years were marked by pain, drugs, and repeated operations on his legs, years of physical agony but unstinting artistic achievement. Here is the book that Porter’s fans have long hoped for—a life that informs the great music and lyrics though illuminating glimpses of the hidden, complicated, private man.",['William McBrien'],Vintage,2011-05-04,['Biography & Autobiography'],1556853149,A16LP6AB6C5LMZ,0/0,3.0,1268524800,An Enjoyable Quick Read,"If looking for a literary classic, this isn't it.

Thick as Thieves,"In this tantalizing thriller from a #1 New York Times bestselling author, a woman uncovers lifelong secrets as she searches for the truth behind her father's involvement in a heist gone wrong. Twenty years ago in the dead of night, four seemingly random individuals pulled the ultimate heist and almost walked away with half a million dollars. But by daybreak, their plan had been shot to hell. One of them was in the hospital. One was in jail. One was dead. And one got away with it.

After countless personal setbacks she decides to return to her family home near mysterious Caddo Lake, and finally get answers to the many questions that torment her.

Ledge Burnet, a rebellious teen at the time of the heist, evaded his jail sentence by enlisting in the army.

Although the two are bound to silence because of the crime they committed together, each has spent years waiting and hoping that the other will make a fatal misstep. But the arrival of their elusive accomplice's daughter, Arden, who may know more about the missing money than she's telling, sets them both on red alert.

"Nutritional Oncology, 2e","Nutritional oncology is an increasingly active interdisciplinary field where cancer is investigated as both a systemic and local disease originating with the changes in the genome and progressing through a multi-step process which may be influenced at many points in its natural history by nutritional factors that could impact the prevention of cancer, the quality of life of cancer patients, and the risk of cancer recurrence in the rapidly increasing population of cancer survivors. Since the first edition of this book was published in 1999, the idea that there is a single gene pathway or single drug will provide a cure for cancer has given way to the general view that dietary/environmental factors impact the progression of genetic and cellular changes in common forms of cancer. This broad concept can now be investigated within a basic and clinical research context for specific types of cancer. This book attempts to cover the current available knowledge in this new field of nutritional oncology written by invited experts. This book attempts to provide not only the theoretical and research basis for nutritional oncology, but will offer the medical oncologist and other members of multidisciplinary groups treating cancer patients practical information on nutrition assessment and nutritional regimens, including micronutrient and phytochemical supplementation. The editors hope that this volume will stimulate increased research, education and patient application of the principles of nutritional oncology. NEW TO THIS EDITION: * Covers hot new topics of nutrigenomics and nutrigenetics in cancer cell growth * Includes new chapters on metabolic networks in cancer cell growth, nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics * Presents substantially revised chapters on breast cancer and nutrition, prostate cancer and nutrition, and colon cancer and nutrition * Includes new illustrations throughout the text, especially in the breast cancer chapter * Includes integrated insights into the unanswered questions and clearly defined objectives of research in nutritional oncology * Offers practical guidelines for clinicians advising malnourished cancer patients and cancer survivors on diet, nutrition, and lifestyle * Provides information on the role of bioactive substances, dietary supplements, phytochemicals and botanicals in cancer prevention and treatment","['George L.

Cadfael is to serve as translator for a group of monks heading to the town of Gwytherin in Wales. The team’s goal is to collect the holy remains of Saint Winifred, which Prior Robert hopes will boost the abbey’s reputation, as well as his own. But when the monks arrive in Gwytherin, the town is divided over the request. When the leading opponent to disturbing the grave is found shot dead with a mysterious arrow, some believe Saint Winifred herself delivered the deadly blow. Brother Cadfael knows an earthly hand did the deed, but his plan to root out a murderer may dig up more than he can handle. Before CSI and Law & Order, there was Brother Cadfael, “wily veteran of the Crusades” (Los Angeles Times). His knowledge of herbalism, picked up in the Holy Land, and his skillful observance of human nature are blessings in dire situations, and earned Ellis Peters a Crime Writers’ Association Silver Dagger Award. A Morbid Taste for Bones kicks off a long-running and much-loved series that went on to be adapted for stage, radio, and television.",['Ellis Peters'],Open Road Media,2014-08-05,['Fiction'],0449207005,A1ZIJ6DWARSE60,11/13,3.0,994032000,A shame I didn't read this one first,"Having read one or two Cadfaels before, I decided it would be far better to try and read the 20 volumes in order, both to increase the sense of storyline and allow myself the feeling of accomplishment.It's a pity that I had to undertake this long journey having read one or two stories previously, because they showed up weaknesses in this story that would otherwise not been noticed so readily.The monks of Shrewsbury need a saint, because everyone else has one. It sounds ridiculous that people, especially monks, would think like this, but it is wholly believable considering just how much the fear of God existed in Cadfael's day. A visitation to one of the brothers and some generally strange antics from one of the younger ones, and the whole party ends up in the small Welsh village of Gwytherin. Cadfael is Welsh and so there is an interpreter. The language barrier is controlled well by Peters, and half trhe time we forget it exists - good storytelling. Anyway, the story meanders as the monks try to wrest the bones of the local Saint Winifred from the Welsh and needless to say they do not like it. Suddenly a murder, and Cadfael is onto it in a flash. The murderer is unmasked and we all go home happy. Or do we?For those familiar with PG Wodehouse's Jeeves and Wooster, the ending in this mystery is rather like one of the cunning and succinct ways in which Jeeves invariably solves all Wooster's woes. Whereas in Jeeves and Wooster we are looking at a comedy, with Cadfael , we have a serious affair. The concise and overtly convenient manner in which Cadfael rounds things off is too much for reality. There was another way to end this story, and one which did not stretch the bounds of belief. But Peters has opted for the clean ending and the whole story suffers.I know the Cadfaels get better, and this volume has not diminished my desire for more of the canny sleuthing monk. I do recommend to anyone that they start at the beginning and so I recommend to anyone, have a stab at this. If you like it, 19 more books sets you up for a while.",2014,en

Een groep schooljongens stort neer op een onbewoond eiland. Zonder ouders of ander volwassen toezicht moeten ze met elkaar samenwerken om te overleven, waar ze jammerlijk in falen.

Personally, by the time I've finished analyzing how Piggy's glasses symbolize human reason, the pig's head represents human evil, etc., the book has lost its impact for me and becomes pretentious.But that is not my main problem with this book. I find it frightening that so many people consider this book 'revealing' and a 'classic'. This seems to indicate that the message of this book has universal relevance for people. And this message is as follows: Humankind, homo sapiens, people as we know them, are intrinsically evil. Meaning, that deep down in our hearts we are nothing but wells of corrupt blackness, or as Conrad so aptly put it, hearts 'of darkness'. Anything good we do is a sham. We act a certain way only because civilization dictates it, but as soon as the rules of civilization no longer get us what we want, or they are no longer imposed on us, our natural tendency will be to fall into evil, our true, innermost nature.Garbage. I for one do not believe that human beings are intrinsically evil. Are they intrinsically good, then? Of course not. I am not advocating a world view based on naivete. Human beings have a natural tendency for both good and for evil. How much these tendencies influence a person's behavior is entirely up to him: he is not wholly at the mercy of his baser instincts. Even in 'Heart of Darkness', upon which Golding based this work, Marlowe faced the evil and did not succumb to it. These boys are given no choice, as evil is the only true reality. There is no way to fight it; one can either surrender to it, or run from it by way of civilization. To take an active stand against it is impossible.Even in 'Les Miserables' during the horrendous poverty and the barricades, where all of civilization is crumbling at its foundations and people are rotting because of it, there are glimpses into the beauty of humankind. Eponine, though sunk in squalor and darkness, finds redemption by saving Marius; this in contrast to her father, whose evil increases all the more. Jean Valjean sinks to the lowest level a human can sink to, yet there is hope for him; and because one person had faith in the good that was inside him, he, too found redemption. There is choice involved, and one can either strive for light, or fall into darkness. Maybe people like Golding because he unintentionally grants justification for the evil Man is capable of--after all, we can't help it. It's our nature. Therefore people need not bother to strive to become better than they are, to actualize the beauty within themselves. Humans have no inner beauty; it is imposed from outside to conceal the horror within.But there is more. And by not realizing that there is more, Golding sells everyone short.",2016,en

And soon Pitt's skills and ingenuity are desperately needed to rescue the team after a suspicious explosion seals them deep underground.

This is one of the best books about the witches of Lancre, starring Granny Weatherwax who is the most indomitable of all indomitable heroines. It is a lot more fun if one is already familiar with the events WYRD SISTERS and WITCHES ABROAD. In this Disc World novel, the three witches have returned from ""furrin parts"" and the kingdom of Lancre needs to be set straight.The king gets a mysterious letter from ""A Friend"" giving him good advice. As a result he does not purpose to Magrat (the youngest witch). He merely informs her that a date has been set for their wedding. Invitations have been sent; the dress ordered and all Magrat has to do is to move into the palace and learn to do tapestry and later on, the royal succession.Nanny Ogg discovers that some young women have been dancing in the all together around the magic stones known as the Dancers. This is serious business as the Dancers are a magical fence keeping back the Queen of the Elves.Terry Pratchett explains his version of ""the Good Folk"" thusly:""Elves are wonderful. They provoke wonder."" They are ""marvelous"" and ""cause marvels""; ""fantastic"" and ""create fantasies""; ""glamorous"" and ""project glamour""; ""enchanting"" and ""weave enchantment"". And he finishes with:""Elves are terrific. They beget terror.""In this one short sentence, Pratchett hooks his modern fantasy on the ancient fears and demons of mankind. He resists making pretty pixies out of nightmares. He satirizes the type of modern fantasy which gives us a cleaned-up, sanitized version of the Middle Ages and he creates a compelling conflict.This is a terrifically funny book that will keep you up at night. Each of the three witches has her own style of fighting back: Magrat in her winged helmet and ruined wedding dress; Nanny Ogg with her secret knowledge of what lies under some very odd mounds; and Granny Weatherwax who as usual, does what no one else can do.And we learn that Granny Weatherwax was once a striking young woman with an ardent admirer!

Tolkien's classic is a timeless tale of good and evil, written in a detailed, powerful style, set in a fictional world of staggering detail and haunting beauty.Following up on events in ""The Hobbit,"" ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" opens with the hobbit Bilbo Baggins departing from the Shire, after many years of living as the town eccentric. He reluctantly leaves his treasured ring of invisibility to his adventurous nephew Frodo, and vanishes into the wild with some dwarves.But Gandalf the wizard, informs Frodo that the Ring is really the Ring of Power, a powerful item that the demonic Dark Lord Sauron has poured his essence and power into. And if Sauron can regain the Ring, he will be able to conquer Middle-Earth.

Meanwhile, the Ring weighs more heavily on Frodo, as he is forced to get help from one of the people he most despised: the Ring's slave Gollum.""Return of the King"" brings the trilogy to an action-packed, slam-bang and ultimately poignant finale. Sam barely rescues Frodo from Sauron's orcs, and the two resume their journey to Mount Doom, barely escaping Sauron's forces. As Aragorn leads the desperate battle against Sauron's armies at the city of Minas Tirith, Frodo falls increasingly under the seductive spell of the Ring.""Lord of the Rings"" is indeed a powerful book, and its timeless messages and quests have shaped the fantasy genre, and crossed the boundaries of literary fiction. At its core it's about the fight of good versus evil, and how ""little people"" can have a strength and willpower that the great and mighty can't even begin to understand.And Middle-Earth is a pretty astounding universe -- not just because Tolkien created a rich back-history for it, but because of the feeling of mystery that hangs around its corners, whether it's dead soldiers or slumbering tree-men. And of course rich cultures of Men, ancient wizards, the stately melancholy elves, and the tough dwarves -- as well as the idyllic Shire, a sort of ancient British countryside which is threatened by corruption.Tolkien's writing is evocative and descriptive, though not to extremes; an elf rider is simple described as shining like a light behind a veil. The story is wrapped in a wide range of dialogue -- from Sam's folksy chat to the Elves' ethereal, formal songs -- and the pacing is slow and gradual, but kept alive by sudden twists of the plot. The first several chapters are kind of slow-moving, but by the time our heroes get to Bree, the pace picks up.Frodo Baggins is an everyman hero, who dreams of adventure but begins to treasure the simple, boring life that he had once he is deprived of it. His deteriotation is saddening, all the more so because he is aware of it. The equally vibrant cast also includes Gandalf the crabby grandfatherly wizard, Sam Gamgee the loyal gardener, and a variety of kings, elves, dwarves, and more lovable little hobbits.Even after all the years, J.R.R.

Free Air,"Free Air Sinclair Lewis - Fame was just around the corner when Sinclair Lewis published Free Air in 1919, a year before Main Street. The latter novel zeroed in on the town of Gopher Prairie; the former stopped there briefly and then took the reader by automobile in search of America. Free Air heads toward a West that was brimming with possibilities for suddenly mobile Americans at the end of a world war.The vehicle in Lewiss novel, not a Model T but a Gomez-Dep roadster, takes Claire Boltwood and her father from Minnesota to Seattle, exposing them all to the perils of early motoring. On the road, the upper-crust Boltwoods are at once more insignificant and more noble. The greatest distance to be overcome is the social one between Claire and a young mechanic named Milt, who, with a cat as his traveling companion, follows close behind. If Free Air anticipates many of the themes of Lewiss later novels, it also looks forward to a genre that includes John Steinbecks Travels with Charley and Josh Greenfeld and Paul Mazurskys Harry and Tonto. And the character of Claire, blazing her own trail across the West, looks back to the nineteenth-century pioneer woman and ahead to the independent-minded movie heroines played by Katherine Hepburn.",['Sinclair Lewis'],Phoemixx Classics Ebooks,2021-11-09,['Juvenile Nonfiction'],0781207665,A1OZWSQ8O44VRG,0/0,4.0,1333584000,A look at yesteryear,"The Author, Sinclair Lewis, represented his era as populated by gullible and naive protagonists and it was a refreshing look at what was expected of authors seventy and more years ago.

Letters of a Woman Homesteader,"This “warmly delightful, vigorously affirmative” memoir of a woman homesteader in early twentieth-century Wyoming inspired the acclaimed film Heartland (The Wall Street Journal). In 1909, Elinore Pruitt answered an ad in the Denver Post to become Henry Clyde Stewart’s housekeeper on his homestead outside Burntfork, Wyoming. Elinore soon fell in love with the land’s vast, untamed beauty, and filed a claim for her own adjoining property under the Homestead Act. Over the next five years, she not only made a home for herself, but traveled extensively across the state, befriending every neighbor within a hundred miles. Through it all—weddings and births, illnesses and snowstorms, changing seasons and changing times—Elinore maintained correspondence with her former employer Juliet Coney in Denver, Colorado. In vivid detail and with lively prose, Elinore told Juliet of life as a woman in the American West. First published in the Atlantic Monthly, these letters made their author an American icon of her time. “Full of the tang of the prairies and of a delightful personality.” —The New York Times",['Elinore Pruitt Stewart'],Open Road Media,2020-03-17,['Literary Collections'],0613082370,A3FZLNLCLMCYC1,0/0,5.0,1326758400,Homesteading joys and sorrows,I loved the humor in the letters to her friend and how resourceful Elinore Pruitt Stewart was creating a home and life for her daughter Jerrine.

During the middle of WWII, a British airplane full of male English schoolchildren is shot done over the Pacific. Upon reaching shore the survivors realize that all the adults died in the crash. The group of boys, aging in range from 6-12, bands together to survive on the island until they can be rescued. The tribe holds an assembly and elects a chief, a bright young man named Ralph. Ralph is a democratic leader and does everything he can to keep things together. He is joined in his efforts by Jack, the lead singer of a group of choir boys who turns the choir into a group of hunters; Piggy, an extremely intelligent boy who is chubby and wears glasses; and Simon, an eccentric young lad who suffers from fainting spells and seems capable of touching the spiritual world. Piggy and Jack don't get along at all. But Ralph and Jack begin things as friends. Things go alright for awhile, but there is a darkness on the island that everyone can feel. As the days pass into weeks, tension develops between Ralph and Jack. In his ambition to feed the tribe with meet, Jack slowly falls under the spell of darkness and becomes filled with pride. He eventually splits the tribe in two. Both pigs and people become slaughtered as civilization falls apart in a world of immoral and unethical chaos.LORD OF THE FLIES is one of my favorite books of all time. I first read it when I was a junior in high school and was deeply impressed by the wonderful story. The story is full of vivid images that become frozen in one's mind.Besides just being a great story, the novel can be read on a variety of levels. For instance, there is the conflict of man versus nature; civilization versus anarchy; democratic principles versus dictatorship. The book could be read as merely a psychological treatise examining the various states of the human mind. Or it can be read as a spiritual metaphor, illustrating the depravity of man outside of God's grace.Besides THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, LORD OF THE FLIES is perhaps the most influential book of the mid-20th Century. The book wasn't well received upon it's initial release, but was ""discovered"" in the 1960s by college students. Since that time it has become a bestseller and a modern classic. It is highly recommended and one of the few books that I believe every American should be familiar with. Beware the Beast!This edition of LORD OF THE FLIES includes an introduction by E.M.

Self-Renewal: The Individual and the Innovative Society,"“The only stability possible is stability in motion.”—John William Gardner In his classic treatise Self-Renewal, John W. Gardner examines why great societies thrive and die. He argues that it is dynamism, not decay, that is dramatically altering the landscape of American society. The twentieth century has brought about change more rapidly than any previous era, and with that came advancements, challenges, and often destruction. Gardner cautions that “a society must court the kinds of change that will enrich and strengthen it, rather than the kind of change that will fragment and destroy it.” A society’s ability to renew itself hinges upon its individuals. Gardner reasons that it is the waning of the heart and spirit—not a lack of material might—that threatens American society. Young countries, businesses, and humans have several key commonalities: they are flexible, eager, open, curious, unafraid, and willing to take risks. These conditions lead to success. However, as time passes, so too comes complacency, apathy, and rigidity, causing motivation to plummet. It is at this junction that great civilizations fall, businesses go bankrupt, and life stagnates. Gardner asserts that the individual’s role in social renewal requires each person to face and look beyond imminent threats. Ultimately, we need a vision that there is something worth saving. Through this vision, Gardner argues, society will begin to renew itself, not permanently, but past its average lifespan, and it will at once become enriched and rejuvenated.",['John W.

But at his mansion east of New York City, in West Egg, Long Island, where the party never seems to end, he's often alone in the glittering Jazz Age crowd, watching and waiting, as speculation swirls around him--that he's a bootlegger, that he was a German spy during the war, that he even killed a man. As writer Nick Carraway is drawn into this decadent orbit, he begins to see beneath the shimmering surface of the enigmatic Gatsby, for whom one thing will always be out of reach: Nick's cousin, the married Daisy Buchanan, whose house is visible from Gatsby's just across the bay. A brilliant evocation of the Roaring Twenties and a satire of a postwar America obsessed with wealth and status, The Great Gatsby is a novel whose power remains undiminished after a century. This edition, based on scholarship dating back to the novel's first publication in 1925, restores Fitzgerald's masterpiece to the original American classic he envisioned, and features an introduction addressing how gender, race, class, and sexuality complicate the pursuit of the American Dream.",['F.

You be the judge!,"The Great Gatsby is an interesting novel which brings the ""Roaring Twenties"" to life. The author of this book certainly knows how to maintain the reader's interest. The main scheme consists of a cast of colorful characters seemingly stuck in what modern day society would call ""a mild soap opera type of lifestyle."" At least each and every one of these characters that the writer, F. Scott Fitzgerald has come up with; either has already or attempts to commit at least one or more of the seven deadly sins. These sins include pride, envy, greed, anger, lust as the main occurrences, with, sloth and gluttony ranking more at the lower end of the events that take place throughout the book.The narrator, Nick Carraway, irreverently states his thoughts and opinions about nearly each and every one of the vibrant characters more than once as the story goes on. Should we as reader's value Nick's opinion is something that you will have to find out for yourself. Nick says, ""Gatsby turns out alright in the end."" I beg to differ with that statement but again, once the reader gets into the story he or she will realize this is a suspenseful plot which leads up to the main idea of who Jay Gatsby really was and what his intentions were as he shared the same social circle as Nick's cousin, Daisy. The ""cast"" includes the infamous Jay Gatsby, who the book revolves around and his former lover, Daisy Buchannan, who decided to marry Tom, who was richer and readily available while Gatsby was away at war. Also worthy of mention is Tom's mistress, Myrtle Wilson who will eventually share the same fate as Jay Gatsby as the story evolves closer to the end of the tremendous fiction.The bottom line being that The Great Gatsby is a great catch and a worthwhile read for any of us.

When the series opens, Jerry is very close to finishing his flight training to become a navy fighter pilot when he is injured in a takeoff accident and medically “grounded.” Still determined to serve in the navy, he fought his way through another difficult and demanding training regimen to become a nuclear submariner. Jerry reports to his first “boat,” USS Memphis, and has to quickly learn a very different world, as well as overcome doubts about his motivations for choosing submarines. Jerry proves himself and more when Memphis’ crew makes an unexpected and dangerous discovery. With each following book, Jerry’s skill set grows as he takes on more responsibilities on board different classes of submarines. He reaches the pinnacle of an outstanding naval career as the commanding officer of USS North Dakota, then becomes a squadron commodore, a job that has more to do with pushing paper than driving submarines. That is, until a good friend and mentor, who just happens to be the president of the United States, orders him to go back to sea on a dangerous mission to stop a nuclear war.

Don't get me wrong - it's not the sour mood of the book, the unhappiness, etc that makes me hate this book - I read Roth's American Pastoral (definitely not a feel-good book) and I loved it. I just felt like this book was terrible. The characters didn't pull me in - I couldn't identify with any of them and I could never get to the point of seeing things from their perspective. A homeless man with some sort of obsession with even numbers? A homeless woman addicted to crack? Even the more 'normal' characters - the ones whose stories set the stage for things going on in the present - just don't pull me in at all.Some books I have read recently that I would recommend: American Pastoral - this book will have you thinking about it for weeks after you read it, Kent Haruf's Plainson (and the sequel, Eventide), and Hamilton's Map of the World.Sorry, folks. I just didn't like this one.",2013,en

George Orwell 1984,"""Nineteen Eighty-Four: A Novel"", often published as ""1984"", is a dystopian social science fiction novel by English novelist George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He enters into a forbidden relationship with a colleague, Julia, and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.",['George Orwell'],epubli,2021-01-09,['Fiction'],B000NHNM3C,A2R3XFLY1XGKKN,1/2,3.0,1345680000,1984... kind of depressing,"I bought this book about 3 weeks ago and I'm still ""trying"" to read it.

A beautiful, deluxe edition of Dodie Smith’s beloved novel, I Capture the Castle, featuring a new foreword by New York Times bestselling author Jenny Han, a stunning new cover, and designed endpapers that is perfect for devoted readers and those discovering this timeless story for the first time. Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain and her family may live in a ramshackle old English castle, but that’s about as romantic as her life gets. While her beautiful older sister, Rose, longs to live in a Jane Austen novel, Cassandra knows that meeting an eligible man to marry isn’t in either of their futures when their home is crumbling and they have to sell their furniture for food. So Cassandra instead strives to hone her writing skills in her journals. Until one day when their new landlords move in, which include two (very handsome) sons, and the lives of the Mortmain sisters change forever. Through Cassandra’s sharply funny, yet poignant, journal entries, she chronicles the great changes that take place within the castle’s walls, and her own first descent into love. By the time she pens her final entry, she has “captured the castle” – and the heart of the reader – in one of literature’s most enchanting novels. “This book has one of the most charismatic narrators I've ever met.” —J.K.

The Wisdom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety,"Alan Watts is ""the perfect guide for a course correction in life, away from materialism and its empty promise"" (Deepak Chopra). Here he shows us how—in an age of unprecedented anxiety—we must embrace the present and live fully in the now in order to live a fulfilling life. Spending all our time trying to anticipate and plan for the future and to lamenting the past, we forget to embrace the here and now. We are so concerned with tomorrow that we forget to enjoy today. Drawing from Eastern philosophy and religion, Alan Watts shows that it is only by acknowledging what we do not—and cannot—know that we can learn anything truly worth knowing. “Perhaps the foremost interpreter of Eastern disciplines for the contemporary West, Watts had the rare gift of ‘writing beautifully the unwritable.’” —Los Angeles Times",['Alan Watts'],Vintage,2011-11-16,['Self-Help'],B0006ASTGQ,A1MYYN2JI4Z2YV,1/1,5.0,1308268800,"Something More Subtle, but of Equal Delight...His Style","His wit, his piercing insight and cleverness at explaining the unexplainable has been duly noted, so I'll leave that to the side and comment on something a bit more subtle but equally delightful and delicious: His nuanced way of speaking, his style and elegance, his ease with the subject matter, and his sense of humor about it all.

Far-fetched, sometimes sinister rumors surround the shut-in writer, but they pale in comparison to the chilling truth: Linda is haunted by the unsolved murder of her younger sister, whom she discovered in a pool of blood twelve years ago, and by the face of the man she saw fleeing the scene.

But the sanctity of this refuge is shattered when her sister's murderer appears again--this time on her television screen. Empowered with sudden knowledge but hobbled by years of isolation, Linda resolves to use her only means of communication with the outside world--the plot of her next novel--to lay an irresistible trap for the man.

Ship of Fools,"This “dazzling” National Book Award finalist set aboard an ocean liner in 1931 reflects the passions and prejudices that sparked World War II (San Francisco Chronicle). August 1931. An ocean liner bound for Germany sets out from the Mexican port city of Veracruz. The ship’s first-class passengers include an idealistic young American painter and her lover; a Spanish dance troupe with a sideline in larceny; an elderly German couple and their fat, seasick bulldog; and a boisterous band of Cuban medical students. As the Vera journeys across the Atlantic, the incidents and intrigues of several dozen passengers and crew members come into razor-sharp focus. The result is a richly drawn portrait of the human condition in all its complexity and a mesmerizing snapshot of a world drifting toward disaster.

I am somewhat of a military/history buff myself. While I am 10 years younger than Tom Clancy, after reading some of the biographical info, there are some similarities in our interests as children. When I was younger I read everthing I could get my hands on pertaining to World War II, fiction and non-fiction. Over the years I've probably seen 85% of all the war movies ever made. The one thing about Tom Clancy's novels that I always find so entertaining is the attention to detail. I too wonder if he doesn't have some inside sources, just as the CIA has wondered (and I'm sure investigated). In my opinion, this man is a first class storyteller who consistently keeps me glued to every one of his books from cover to cover. Witout Remorse is no exception. In fact I'd say it is exceptional. After reading Clancy's first six books, this one made me feel like I knew the character he was writing about intimately. Which leads me to the next point, anyone who can take reading a work of fiction by a popular author who unabashedly loves his country and turn it into a judgement call aimed at everyone living on this side of the pond ought to stick to reading romance novels. I've never gotten the impression from any of Clancy's works that he was trying to ram any kind of holier than thou attitude down anyone's throat. As far as being involved with unspeakable atrocities, the gentleman from Liverpool need look no further than the few centuries preceding the American Revolution or perhaps right in his own backyard in present-day Northern Ireland. The British Empire has done it's fair share of imposing it's will on an unwilling world for quite a long time. And of course there was that nasty little uprising in the Faulkland Islands.

The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,"A good book may have the power to change the way we see the world, but a great book actually becomes part of our daily consciousness, pervading our thinking to the point that we take it for granted, and we forget how provocative and challenging its ideas once were—and still are. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach. With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don’t arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of “normal science,” as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age. This new edition of Kuhn’s essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn’s ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking’s introduction provides important background information as well as a contemporary context. Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science.",['Thomas S. Kuhn'],University of Chicago Press,2012-04-18,['Science'],0226458083,A3VRIV9FM5AHU1,3/3,5.0,1214092800,Not Just for Those Interested in Science,"Essential reading in understanding why the Enlightenment ideal of rationality is dead or at least doesn't count in ways that matter. In particular, Kuhn calls into question the idea of science as a rational enterprise, and since science is epistemologically privileged and thought to be the essence of rationality, to call into question the rationality of science is to call into question rationality itself. This is different, I submit, than the anti-rationality of the deconstructionists (e.g., Derrida), which seems to lack immediate real world consequences (aside form contributing to a sense of alienation in some). I find Hegel to be a precursor of Kuhn. Hegel attempted to describe how we come to believe what we believe, and Kuhn attempts to do this in the field of science, and, it should be added, with much more accessibly.There are some who will find Kuhn lacking all coherence (sophisticated BS, as one person put it), and that is another way of saying ""irrational"". For those who associate irrationality with things like religious fundamentalism, irrationalism is a fearful thing. Yet, it is rationality itself that has been called into question by the events of the 20th century, beginning with the carnage of WWI. The answer is not more rationalism. Rationalism, the primacy of reason and the center of modernism, is itself a belief, and the crisis of modernity is the recognition that reason has no more claim to a privileged position than religion. The answer may be, as Rorty has pointed out, deciding what we want to believe without being forced to justify the basis of those beliefs: we believe because our beliefs support what we hold to be good things(neo-pragmatism) That may be a fearful thing for those who don't find complete correspondence between their beliefs and Rorty's privileged beliefs. What, though, it does show, is that irrationality is not sufficient grounds for being dismissive. In doing so one may be taking a stance on the wrong side of the arrow of history.The arrow, though, is not that of the Whig theory of history, where things constantly improve driven by reason. Historians of this view (as well as much of popular culture) denigrate older views by degrading them to myth or religious belief status. This gives a privileged position to our own, contemporary beliefs and gives us a sense of comfort. Kuhn disturbs this comfortable view by showing, for example, that Ptolemaic astronomy gave plausible answers to questions of the day. So too, one could argue that the contemporary dismissive view of Scholastic philosophy is more the result of Enlightenment propaganda than of merit. At the least, Kuhn is a good (partial) antidote for contemporary smugness --- a challenge to bourgeois sentiment. Kuhn, though, is much more than a cultural caution; he is an important voice in the contemporary philosophical debate.Who would like ""The Structure of Scientific Revolutions""? Those who like ideas with profound consequences easily presented. Kuhn is a Nietzsche, and like Nietzsche is at the very least a fun read. He is much more if taken seriously.",2012,en
My Life in Orange,"A memoir of formative years spent on a series of communes: A “wonderful account of a frankly ghastly childhood . . . Hilarious and heartbreaking” (Daily Mail). At the age of six, Tim Guest was taken by his mother to a commune modeled on the teachings of the notorious Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh. The Bhagwan preached an eclectic doctrine of Eastern mysticism, chaotic therapy, and sexual freedom, and enjoyed inhaling laughing gas, preaching from a dentist's chair, and collecting Rolls Royces. Tim and his mother were given Sanskrit names, dressed entirely in orange, and encouraged to surrender themselves into their new family. While his mother worked tirelessly for the cause, Tim—or Yogesh, as he was now called—lived a life of well-meaning but woefully misguided neglect in various communes in England, Oregon, India, and Germany. In 1985 the movement collapsed amid allegations of mass poisonings, attempted murder, and tax evasion, and Yogesh was once again Tim. In this extraordinary memoir, Tim Guest chronicles the heartbreaking experience of being left alone on earth while his mother hunted heaven. “An intelligent, wry, openhearted memoir of surviving a childhood and a cultural phenomenon that were both extraordinary.” —Booklist (starred review)",['Tim Guest'],HMH,2016-03-01,['Biography & Autobiography'],B000GNZ06A,A2HM6MFN3AD7T9,3/4,5.0,1209081600,Remarkable & memorable,"Without reservation, I recommend MY LIFE IN ORANGE. You are in for a bumpy ride, however, on which your assumptions & judgments really need to be checked at the gate.This is about British disaffected Baby Boomers who first got into grassroots politics until they heard the siren song of the Raggle Taggle Gypsy, the psychic Pied Piper known as Bhagwan Rajneesh.MY LIFE IN ORANGE is all about a child's eye view of living in a collection of communes on three continents made up of people from disparate walks of life whose eyes are set on their quest for enlightenment, rather than on the prize of parenthood.I was an ex-Brit Baby Boomer who took a similar hike albeit through different terrain & my path once crossed with the Orange Cloud, as well as other guru groups. Perhaps my coming up as a ""stranger"" in a post-War society that set too much store in their ethnic purity, in an education system that thought their religion was the only one &, finally, behind 3 older brothers, all inoculated me against any male guru adoration. I, too, went in search of commune life, although my taste was more of the SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS kind, which doesn't exist off the silver screen, more's the pity.The telling of MY LIFE IN ORANGE is a profound immersion into Tim Guest's memories of idyllic communes before being dragged off by the adults in his life to treacherous territories where children are treated, at best, like a herd of goats. There are some hindsight insights blended into this feast of memories & stories about a time when a child's life was indeed free. However, as Tim so ably describes, the lines between freedom & abandonment, instincts & politics, ecstasy & emptiness, affection & antipathy are very thin.MY LIFE IN ORANGE will make you think about becoming a parent, an adult, a leader & a follower. It also has something to say about how a child looks at its parents' lives.PS: to all the defensive ones, there's little in Tim's telling that can be construed as anti-Bhagwan. It's in the mind of the reader, if they're so inclined, especially those who've not even read the book. Duh!",2016,en

Based on Hemingway's experiences, it is the story of a group of American and English expatriates living in Paris who take an excursion to Pamplona, Spain. The novel has forever associated Hemingway with bullfights and the running of the bulls.

Two years before the mast: A personal narrative of life at sea,"This book is a fascinating and detailed chronicle of over two years spent in the American merchant service during the early 1800s. Written as a journal, it depicts the adventures and vicissitudes of a young sailor travelling from Boston around Cape Horn and on to the west coast of North America. Brought to life with a vividness that belies its age, “Two Years Before the Mast” is highly recommended for lovers of adventure writing and those with an interest in nautical history. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. It is with this in mind that we are republishing this volume now in an affordable, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author.",['R. H. Dana'],Read Books Ltd,2016-03-09,['Sports & Recreation'],B00089ZLFM,A3G2IL9KI6BKIG,2/3,4.0,1207526400,"Thrilling, tedious","It took me quite a while to read this book; I wouldn't call it a page turner. But I'm quite sure I will remember it as vividly as almost any book I've ever read. It is a very detailed, true description of an exceptional, very-well-educated young man's two year stint on a trading ship which sailed from Boston around Cape Horn to a very primitive, pre-Gold-Rush, California and back. There isn't a whole lot of suspense because we know, since it's a true story, that the author makes it back. And there isn't a great deal of concern about his shipmates and the other people he meets in his amazing travels, because their characters are never consistently developed. Rather, Dana may spend a page on a specific person and then never refer much to that person again. But I believe that this is the way Dana intended it -- as a story of the sea, and merchant seamen as a class of people, and the incredible dangers and hardships they face on a daily basis. In that regard, the main character of the story becomes this universal seaman, sometimes Dana, sometimes an unnamed or named crew member (but often named just as Mr. S______ or the like), sometimes spoken of as a composite (""Jack""). This gives the tale a transcendent, universal feel and makes it all the more powerful -- rather than the typical bad-guy, good-guy approach. The details of how the ship and crew function and the operation of the sails, etc. are explained in great and loving detail in nautical/technical terms that were, in the beginning, often incomprehensible and boring to me -- but for which I gained a taste for reading as the story progressed, even if I still didn't know quite what was actually happening or what exactly he was describing. Especially memorable was his ship's return trip around unpredictable, fierce Cape Horn with an exhausted, ailing, too-small crew. The afterword that was written 24 years later when Dana returned to a post-Gold-Rush California and reviews the places where he had his adventure as a young man, including reacquaintance with some of the characters of the main story, was one of the best parts of the book; quite poignant. If you want to experience a completely different way of life in a very different time, this may be the book for you...",2016,en
House of Bones,"A chilling twist on the haunted-house story as five strangers resolve to spend two weeks in an abandoned, high-rise urban housing project that even gang lords and crack dealers avoid . . . Chicago’s Dreamland Housing Project was created to give people with nothing a second chance. Like so many ill-conceived dreams of its time, eventually the project fell into disrepair and disrepute, just another slum ruled by the gangs and the drug dealers. But there was one building in the complex that contained an evil far fouler than the kind running the streets. Here eerie sounds emanated nightly from the elevator shafts and the shadows at the far end of the hallways, and inexplicable, fatal “accidents” were the norm. Here human blood regularly soaked the walls and cheap carpeting as rapists and murderers ran rampant, though none could remember their dark deeds afterward. Now, decades later, Dreamland is empty of its residents and mostly demolished. But one building still stands, thanks to billionaire Ramsey Lomax, who won’t let the city raze the last and most notorious tower until he is done with it. Along with four willing strangers—a writer, an ex-cop, a doctor, and a psychic, each with a reason for participating—Lomax intends to spend two weeks living in the abandoned tower to see if the legends are real. But nothing can prepare these five for the terror they encounter once the front door slams behind them, trapping them all inside. Because in Dreamland, every nightmare comes true.",['Dale Bailey'],Open Road Media,2014-07-22,['Fiction'],0451210794,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,4/7,3.0,1076198400,WRITING ABILITY 10 ENJOYMENT 3,"There's no doubt that Dale Bailey knows how to use the English language...perhaps too well. The book seems long, long, long....so much of it is spent on teasing the reader with the dark secrets our characters hold. But he overdoes it, even using redundant passages to keep us hooked, without any real payoff. By the time the book reaches a point where something is really going on, you've had to test your own endurance levels to get there. At what point does a reader have to admire a writer's command of language enough to forget you're yawning more than feeling the chills he obviously wants us to? The characters are well drawn, but I found his choice of who to use for the final villain a little disconcerting. Oh, well, variety is the spice of life. I just didn't enjoy this book.",2014,en
FIFTH ELEPHANT (DISCWORLD),"Everyone knows that the world is flat and supported on the backs of four elephants. But weren't there supposed to be five? Indeed there were. So where is it? When duty calls, Commander Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork constabulary answers—even if he doesn't want to. Now, he's been invited to attend a royal function as both detective and diplomat. The one role he relishes; the other requires, well, ruby tights. Of course, where cops (even those clad in tights) go, alas, crime follows. An attempted assassination and a theft soon lead to a desperate chase from the low halls of Discworld royalty to the legendary fat mines of Uberwald, where lard is found in underground seams along with tusks and teeth and other precious ivory artifacts. It's up to the dauntless Vimes—bothered as usual by a familiar cast of Discworld inhabitants (you know, trolls, dwarfs, werewolves, vampires, and such)—to solve the puzzle of the missing pachyderm.

Satan and his gospel,"Is the Devil a living reality, or is he nothing more than a figment of the imagination? Is the word ""Satan"" merely a synonym for wickedness, or does it stand for a concrete entity? In cultured circles it has become the custom to return a negative answer to these questions, and to flatly deny the existence of the Tempter. Among such people it is regarded as a mark of intellectual superiority to repudiate the personality of the Devil. By many, Satan is now looked upon as a product of priestcraft, a relic of superstition, the myth of a bygone age. With others, Satan is simply an abstraction, a mere negation, the opposite of good. ""All the Devil there is, is the devil within you,"" is the last word of ""modern thought."" The words which Goethe puts into the mouth of Mephistopholes""I am the Spirit of Negation""is accepted as a good workable definition of the Devil. He is regarded as a mere abstract principle of evil. As someone has quaintly put it, ""They spell Devil without a 'd', as they spell God with two 'o's'. Good and evil is their scheme."" Totally based on the scriptures. This book presents biblical answers to that subject.",['Arthur Pink'],Darolt Books,2020-07-15,['Bibles'],B0007H0PAQ,A14YAPN80W740G,0/0,5.0,1360454400,great item,"condition of book was great, better than the description, easy to read,recommended for every library, very in depth yet very simple",2020,en

I didn't like the teacher much, hadn't been impressed by his choices before, and had been expecting another novel about the woes of the Holocaust period, so I was relunctant to pick this book up, but once I did, I just couldn't put it down.The Chosen is a novel about two boys (Reuven Malter and Daniel Saunders) on the brink of manhood (15 years old, both of them) who are struggling with the values of the community they live in. Danny is a member of the Hasidic community- his father is the Rebbe (which, for those of you who don't know, is different from the rabbi, and is I believe, the second most powerful leader next to God in the religious community), and Danny will eventually inherit that position from his father. However, there is a problem . . . Danny doesn't want to be a rebbe, he wants to be a psychologist, despite his obligation and the fact that his father apparently thinks that the world outside of Judaism is wicked. Danny spends his afternoons shut up in the library reading because he's driven by a desire to know about the world. The novel essentially centers around the struggle about Danny's desires and that of his father for him, between Danny and Reuven's friendship, and, of course, the Holocaust and WWII, which are both going on throughout the novel, though surprisingly, Potok leaves out any mention of the Holocaust whatsoever until the end of the novel.The Chosen is an intriguing read- not something you can read on the bus to school, or on the plane to whatever destination, though.

However, using the Internet to carry sensitive information can present serious privacy and security problems.

Using an example-driven approach, VPNs Illustrated explores how tunnels and VPNs function by observing their behavior ""on the wire."" By learning to read and interpret various network traces, such as those produced by tcpdump, readers will be able to better understand and troubleshoot VPN and network behavior. Specific topics covered include: Block and stream symmetric ciphers, such as AES and RC4; and asymmetric ciphers, such as RSA and EIGamal Message authentication codes, including HMACs Tunneling technologies based on gtunnel SSL protocol for building network-to-network VPNs SSH protocols as drop-in replacements for telnet, ftp, and the BSD r-commands Lightweight VPNs, including VTun, CIPE, tinc, and OpenVPN IPsec, including its Authentication Header (AH) protocol, Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), and IKE (the key management protocol) Packed with details, the text can be used as a handbook describing the functions of the protocols and the message formats that they use.

"The big four;: The story of Huntington, Stanford, Hopkins, and Crocker, and of the building of the Central Pacific","Here for the first time is told in a single volume one of the most remarkable stories in American history. An Eastener is never long in California without hearing something of “the big four”: four Sacramento shopkeepers—Collis P. Huntington, Lelan Stanford, Mark Hopkins, and Charles Crocker—who got control of the newly organized Central Pacific Railroad property. These men are portrayed in Mr. Lewis’s volume vividly and with a great wealth or pertinent anecdote. Thus their true characters are revealed and the grandiose era in which they lived and operated is re-created as well. Huntington, the shrewd manipulator and lobbyist in Washington, founded the great fortune which is responsible for the magnificent library at San Marino; Leland Stanford, Governor of California and United States Senator, created Leland Stanford Junior University; Hopkins, the cold, quiet watchdog of the railroad’s treasury, kept himself out of the limelight, out of politics and scandal, yet, like the others, died enormously wealthy; while Crocker founded a dynasty of bankers still important in the affairs of California and the nation.

You get all the fables with the addition of excellent line drawings to illustrate the various tales. The fables are very short and simple and are usually only a paragraph or two. Occasionally they will have a sentence underneath explaining the moral of the fable but generally you are left to work it our for yourself. A few of the fables seem to have no point whatsoever, they are simply a telling of a conversation between two animals for example, but not every fable has to have a moral or meaning behind it for you to enjoy it. As one of my friends pointed out, there are some quite dark tales in here, like one animal flaying another animals skin to wear it, and I guess in todays sanitised society this may shock some parents or kids, but this is pretty benign stuff and classic children's literature that can teach some valuable lessons. It is surprising just how many of these fables you know from your own childhood and how many of todays everyday phrases come from these stories. This would be perfect for bedtime stories as the fables are short, often involve talking animals and carry a message. A classic book and a simple yet attractive edition.

Women,"Data is fundamental to the modern world. From economic development, to healthcare, to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias, in time, money, and often with their lives.

George Orwell 1984,"""Nineteen Eighty-Four: A Novel"", often published as ""1984"", is a dystopian social science fiction novel by English novelist George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He enters into a forbidden relationship with a colleague, Julia, and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.",['George Orwell'],epubli,2021-01-09,['Fiction'],B000NHNM3C,A3SQQYS79AV13M,2/2,5.0,1353283200,Freedom is the freedom to say that 2+2=4,"""Freedom is the freedom to say that 2+2=4."" Winston Smith in Gorge Orwell's 1984 is forced to accept anything the Party of Oceana tells him, not only must he accept it but he also must believe it. If they say that 2+2=5 then he must believe it even knowing it is not true, this action of forced acceptance is called doublethink- the idea that you can hold two seemingly apposing concepts and accept both as true.Winston does not truly believe The Party and begins to work against it under the radar even while knowing he is bound to fail. As the story progresses he befriends a young woman named Julia and together they attempt to do the party harm through their own mini rebellion.Winston and Julia are believable though not lovable. I don't think Orwell wanted them to be lovable so he could emphasize how The Party sucked the humanness and lovability out of its subjects.The story was incredibly well written. It was simple to understand, even though Winston and Julia's situation was far from simple.This would be a good book for anyone from fourteen up. This was a great book that deserves it many awards.*This review is written by my son- 14 years old",2021,en

Lord of the flies,"William Golding’s unforgettable classic of boyhood adventure and the savagery of humanity comes to Penguin Classics in a stunning Graphic Deluxe Edition with a new foreword by Lois Lowry As provocative today as when it was first published in 1954, Lord of the Flies continues to ignite passionate debate with its startling, brutal portrait of human nature. William Golding’s compelling story about a group of very ordinary boys marooned on a coral island has been labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, and even a vision of the apocalypse. But above all, it has earned its place as one of the indisputable classics of the twentieth century for readers of any age. This Penguin Classics Graphic Deluxe Edition features an array of special features to supplement the novel, including a foreword by Lois Lowry, an introduction by Stephen King, an essay by E. M. Forster, an essay on teaching and reading the novel and suggestions for further exploration by scholar Jennifer Buehler, and an extended note by E. L. Epstein, the publisher of the first American paperback edition of Lord of the Flies. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

The setting is an island; the cast is a bunch of stranded 6 to 13 year olds. The major characters are Jack Merridew (the bully), Piggy (the dweeb) and Ralph (The chief and someone in between).Lord of the Flies is a journey of civilised minds turning savage. Everything starts off hunky dory as the children realise they have the whole island to themselves and that no adult is there to govern their behaviour. Everything begins in a civil manner: a leader is chosen (Ralph), the hunters are elected (Jack is the leader of the hunters) and priorities are set (that of making smoke so that nearby ships may spot them, and obtaining meat).Of course, these are nascent minds deprived of a social structure, technology and a family system and so they eventually succumb to savagery.This could have been a fantastic psychological story; one that I feel could have attracted a reader from any generation. Unfortunately, more ink is spent on giving visual descriptions of the island and rocks and reeds than it is on the actual story. Coming to the descriptions, they are fantastic and perhaps the only feature of the novel worthy of merit, though I did think sometimes that Sir Golding should have let my imagination fill in some of the bits too.No matter how much sophistry one may use, no matter how much we may wish to incorporate Freud and Jung and whomever else, I feel the story rushed too quickly. Sir Golding did our work of visualising the island but burdened us with the responsibility of making all the important decisions regarding character developments.Take, for example, the killing of a beast/a pig. The reader was deprived of the feelings the youngsters (Jack, Roger etc) must have gone through when they were contemplating killing a beast, skinning it, stabbing it and running the sharp tools across its throat. They are children for God sake, they wouldn't just go out there and start killing. What would have driven children to kill another animal? Not much stress was placed upon hunger, the driving force behind all of this.This is just one example but the readers will find other examples too, as they go through the chapters.I feel this story could have tapped into something spectacular but with 120 thousand words...maybe not. Perhaps Sir Golding had youngsters as his target audience and so I would not come into this at all...",2016,en
The Moor: A Mary Russell Novel,"In the eerie wasteland of Dartmoor, Sherlock Holmes summons his devoted wife and partner, Mary Russell, from her studies at Oxford to aid the investigation of a death and some disturbing phenomena of a decidedly supernatural origin. Through the mists of the moor there have been sightings of a spectral coach made of bones carrying a woman long-ago accused of murdering her husband--and of a hound with a single glowing eye. Returning to the scene of one of his most celebrated cases, The Hound of the Baskervilles, Holmes and Russell investigate a mystery darker and more unforgiving than the moors themselves.",['Laurie R.

Then when I saw Sherlock Holmes had been teamed with a female partner, Mary Russell, I was hooked. This is a delightful book!Interestingly, the author provides an editor's note in which it is claimed that the manuscripts have been found and were originally written by Ms. Russell. This is an added note that lends a curious, but nonetheless minor, twist, because as with any mystery involving Holmes, you soon get so tied up into the story that it matters little who is the author.Later in Sherlock Holmes's life, we find that he has taken not only a new partner . . . but she has become his wife! Mary Russell, who prefers to go by that name, is an intellectual, an Oxford student of theology, and, once in a while, partner to the famous sleuth. What is interesting is that the story is oftentimes written from the point of view of Ms. Russell. This change is almost transparent, yet lends a new and highly entertaining perspective to the traditional cases where Holmes is the leader in finding clues and solving the case. For King has ""humanized"" Sherlock in a gentle, loving way and allows him to call upon his wife for help in a way that shows both his love and respect. A truly delightful team!The Moor takes us to Dartmoor, where Holmes once solved the case of the hound of the Baskervilles, at the request of the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould. Nearing his 90th year, in the early 1920s, the Reverend has summoned his godson, Sherlock, to find out what is happening on the moors. There have been strange sightings of a coach and dog, claimed to be a woman who married a local lord who soon died. She ""was never officially accused and tried, but for her sins she is said to be condemned to riding in a coach made of the bones of her dead husbands, driven by a headless horseman and led by a black hound with a single eye in the centre of his forehead."" More importantly, a local man has been killed and found on the moors.The book opens with Mary Russell receiving a telegram to come immediately to Devonshire . . . and to bring her compass. Mary is not thrilled to be summoned and returns to her reading only to receive another telegram two hours later to ""bring maps, close her books . . . and leave now."" This tug and pull of the two individuals in their own professional lives erupts throughout the book to show each person's independence, yet reliance on each other. This presents an intriguing diversion from reviewing the clues, until both are so caught up in solving the mystery that, upon meeting after each doing their own research, they both proclaim the resolution of the case!The exploration of the moors, its occupants, its hidden dangers are reminiscent of other stories set in Dartmoor, but still beckon and capture the reader to roam through the site, inspecting each stone, each change in the weather, and what it may mean and how it can help solve the mystery. The characters brought forth are charming and serve to introduce you to the community of those who become close by necessity as they must depend upon each other in this strange, wild land. Ms. Russell's love of reading takes her into the hundreds of books written by Reverend Baring-Gould, where she finds ""pieces"" of evidence that slowly pull together to help solve the case.In the end, the activity behind the mystery is somewhat mundane-the salting of gold by an unscrupulous pair, one of whom is the illegitimate son of a Baskerville. However, watching the Holmes couple go their respective ways, to gain and add to the clues that leads to the final discovery, provides a new dimension for Sherlock Holmes's fans. If you're one . . . look for the entire series with Mary Russell. You'll be glad to visit with Sherlock once again and meet this new partner and wife!",2014,en

This book is bloated with 500-800 pages of some of the most boring drivel you'll ever read. After reading Salem's Lot again for probably the tenth time (my personal favorite of King's novels and arguably his most frightening and CONCISE novel) I decided to read the Stand again.I had read it 25 years ago in high school and had fond memories of the book and knew its plot points. I can't believe King actually thinks his readers will be fooled that he has 'improved' upon the original work. It's clear he dislikes editors, you know, those rational professionals who turn a DRAFT into a full working novel. It's like King went through his original book and on every page inserted paragraphs of internal thoughts that go nowhere and add nothing to the plot just to ramble on about nonsense, bodily functions, whether a corpse's breasts are hard or soft(!).Fran, arguably a 'heroine' of the novel, was already bland to me in the original version, this coming from someone who almost loved the 70's Stand; in this version, King piles on pages after pages of worthless details to the point that I hated her and wanted her to die. I felt like I had to slough through her chapters--and other useless characters--to get to the good parts I already knew were there. This book is one of the worst travesties to be foisted on the reading public in publishing history. It's pure drivel and diarrhea of the brain! Read the 70's version, or better yet, read Salem's Lot, The Shining, or anything else King wrote before Pet Semetary--when in my opinion he transformed into an unapologetical hack.

""My Fractured Life"" is probably the closest argument, and even that you have to question because it is so contemporary.

The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library),"A must-have new edition of one of the great American novels--and one of America's most popular--featuring a new introduction by Min Jin Lee, the New York Times bestselling author of Pachinko, and a striking new cover that brings the quintessential novel of the Roaring Twenties into the 2020s A Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition Young, handsome, and fabulously rich, Jay Gatsby seems to have everything. But at his mansion east of New York City, in West Egg, Long Island, where the party never seems to end, he's often alone in the glittering Jazz Age crowd, watching and waiting, as speculation swirls around him--that he's a bootlegger, that he was a German spy during the war, that he even killed a man. As writer Nick Carraway is drawn into this decadent orbit, he begins to see beneath the shimmering surface of the enigmatic Gatsby, for whom one thing will always be out of reach: Nick's cousin, the married Daisy Buchanan, whose house is visible from Gatsby's just across the bay. A brilliant evocation of the Roaring Twenties and a satire of a postwar America obsessed with wealth and status, The Great Gatsby is a novel whose power remains undiminished after a century. This edition, based on scholarship dating back to the novel's first publication in 1925, restores Fitzgerald's masterpiece to the original American classic he envisioned, and features an introduction addressing how gender, race, class, and sexuality complicate the pursuit of the American Dream.",['F.

I usually review the books I read here, but since this book is closing in on being 100 years old, is required reading in many American AP high school English courses and most likely everything that could possibly be said about it by the human race, positive and negative, has been said by reviewers of higher importance than I, I thought it would be silly to review it.But here's this: I liked it. I liked it quite a lot. As much as I read, it's almost absurd that I hadn't gotten to this one sooner, but I'm glad I read it at this age because I almost surely wouldn't have appreciated it in it's fullness if I'd read it in high school.My wife recently read it for the second time (and she loves it), and though our taste in books is usually pretty far from similar, she insisted I really ought to give it a whirl. I was in the mood for something older and in the modern classic realm, so here we are.I have to say it went by fast. I mean, it's a short novel; less than 200 pages. But I daresay once things get cooking (once Gatsby actually enters the novel, basically), it's almost written in a jumpy, quick-moving way. Sure, there are moments of quiet beauty and reminiscence, but the party scenes are perfect depictions of swirling chaos from loud-mouthed, gossipy rich people from the perspective of a man who largely keeps to himself. I love how well the tone of the dialogue encapsulates the time period and suggests that most of the folks were talking just to hear their own voices, responding with answers that had nothing to do with the previous speaker, and no one really listened and no one really cared (again I'm referring primarily to the rich folks at the parties... not necessarily Gatsby or the other main characters, though Daisy shows some hints of this high-living arrogance).This is getting dangerously close to a review (MAY IT NEVER BE, GAINES!!), so I'll wrap up. I reckon this is a novel with layers; something short and rich that reveals more good stuff every time you re-read it. That being said, I'm fairly certain I'll revisit this book somewhere down the road.",2021,en

Even though his contemporaries considered it so offensive that some argued for his prosecution, Dorian Gray today survives as a classic philosophical novel that explores themes of aestheticism and double lives.

The Federalist Papers,"The Federalist Papers (1787-1788) is a collection of essays and articles by Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison. Written in support of the recently completed Constitutional Convention, The Federalist Papers were intended to support the ratification process of the new United States Constitution. When the Constitutional Convention was completed on September 17, 1787 in Philadelphia, the newly-agreed upon Constitution was sent to the states for ratification. As opponents of a strong centralized government began attacking the Constitution in the press, Hamilton recruited Jay and Madison to contribute articles and essays in favor of Federalism to prominent journals and newspapers. Published between October 27, 1787 and May 28, 1788, The Federalist Papers were written by the three authors under the pseudonym “Publius.” Although Hamilton wrote the vast majority, Madison’s and Jay’s contributions are still seen as essential works on the philosophy of American governance. Federalist Nos. 10 and 14, both written by Madison, are regarded as especially significant for arguing for the possibility of effectively governing an expansive republic. In Federalist No. 84, Hamilton argues against adding a Bill of Rights, a proposed compromise with Anti-Federalists that would eventually make up the first ten Amendments to the Constitution. Other important topics introduced or explained in The Federalist Papers include the doctrine of judicial review, the case for a single chief executive, and the purpose of checks and balances. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of The Federalist Papers is a classic of American political history reimagined for modern readers.","['Alexander Hamilton', 'John Jay', 'James Madison']",Graphic Arts Books,2021-02-16,['Political Science'],B000HUASZK,A3V9DLEL53F1US,17/20,5.0,1079481600,The Foundation of an Unique Government,"The Federalist Papers are rightly considered one of the most authoritative explanations of the provisions of the Constitution in existence.

I graduated from Claremont McKenna College at a time when the Straussians were battling for their intellectual position that great thinkers must be understood as they understood themselves. They argued for absolute standards and the importance of great truths in the traditions of Western Civilization. Allan Bloom, Saul Bellow's good friend and fellow scholar at the University of Chicago, served as the basis for the novel's central character, Abe Ravelstein. Bloom was one of the leaders of the Straussian Movement, and Claremont McKenna College was where the Straussians held their California foothold. We were all required to read Bloom's books and hear him speak every time he was in town. I am fascinated how this purely intellectual figure has been transformed by his pal Saul Bellow into the complex fictional character who is the title character of this novel. This book is fascinating to me for largely personal reasons dealing with my undergraduate education. It is also a fine novel, one of the best Bellow has written in recent years. I am amazed at the huge popularity of this book among the general public. I doubt if any contemporary author other than America's greatest living literary giant, Saul Bellow, could have accomplished such an achievement.",2015,en

Lewis","The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950) is a children's fantasy novel, the first and best-known in C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. During World War II, four siblings are sent from London to a house in the country, where they are drawn into a magical world ruled by an evil witch.Here, Lewis introduces the reader to a charming fantasy world populated with creatures drawn from Norse and Greek mythology. This kind of world will be instantly familiar to fantasy readers of all ages, as Lewis, one of the cornerstones of the modern high fantasy genre, has inspired a great deal of imitation (and, let's be honest, some outright cribbing).Lewis's narration is perfect for the children's genre: it is full of quaint homey details and little assurances to the reader (he also speeds through what would otherwise be graphic or horrific scenes). Additionally, Lewis does a nice job giving all four siblings the broad strokes of distinct personalities in such a short book.While The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is not an allegory in the strict sense of the word, it does contain a great deal of strong and rather unmistakable Christian imagery. The most apparent such imagery centers around Aslan, who is an obvious Christ figure, and whose fate parallels Christ's Passion. Indeed, while Aslan debuts rather late in the book, he dominates the story, which is, at its core, all about what Aslan is doing rather than what the children are doing.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a delightful read and a wonderful initiation to the world of Narnia.

Mein Kampf: My Struggle,"‘MEIN KAMPF’ is the autobiography of Adolf Hitler gives detailed insight into the mission and vision of Adolf Hitler that shook the world. This book is the merger of two volumes. The first volume of MEIN KAMPF’ was written while the author was imprisioned in a Bavarian fortress. The book deals with events which brought the author into this blight. It was the hour of Germany’s deepest humiliation, when Napolean has dismembered the old German Empire and French soldiers occupied almost the whole of Germony. The books narrates how Hitler was arrested with several of his comrades and imprisoned in the fortress of Landsberg on the river Lech. During this period only the author wrote the first volume of MEIN KAMPF. The Second volume of MEIN KAMPF was written after release of Hitler from prison and it was published after the French had left the Ruhr, the tramp of the invading armies still echoed in German ears and the terrible ravages had plunged the country into a state of social and economic Chaos. The beauty of the book is, MEIN KAMPF is an historical document which bears the emprint of its own time. Moreover, Hitler has declared that his acts and ‘public statements’ constitute a partial revision of his book and are to be taken as such.

I wanted to know why he did what he did. But, more than that, I wanted to know the truth behind the argument. Everyone compares their political opponents to Hitler. The Left accuses the Right of being like HItler. And the Right accuses the Left of being like Hitler. I wanted to KNOW who was right. This book answered that question. (The answer is: Thankfully, NO ONE in modern American Politics is like Hitler in any important respect. Yes, he was a socialist, but the reason for his socialism and method for achieving it are COMPLETELY different from the modern American socialists like Barack Obama.)I learned a lot reading this book. I learned a lot about the rise of the National Socialist Movement (at least from Hitler's point of view). Before reading, many parts of WWII history seemed unrelated to me-but now I can see how they are linked (at least in Hitler's mind.) But, the biggest thing I learned makes me profoundly sad. World War II need never have happened. He could have been stopped. It was ALL there either in explicit form, or by logical extension considering the work as a whole. The anschluss with Austria, the alliance with Russia that wasn't really an alliance, the invasion of Poland, the invasion of Russia, the invasion France, and even the actions against the Jews-it was all there. Any statesman reading Mein Kampf in the 1930s should have seen that Hitler was following his domestic agenda exactly as laid out in Mein Kampf and realized that he MEANT every word! This should have set off the alarm bells-and actions taken to stop him.If we are smart, we will learn our lesson time Mein Kampf. Our modern day politicians should look around at what various world leaders say about hostile intentions an take it seriously.Now, about the experience of reading this book. For a moment, forget the evil this man did. Forget all the anti-semetism in this book. Forget all the foreshadowing of things to come. This is a TERRIBLY written book. Large sections of this book seemed to be a stream of consciousness rant about some minor incident or obscure line of thought. This made it incredibly difficult maintain my attention.

The Group,"This smash bestseller about privileged Vassar classmates shocked America in the sixties and remains “juicy . . . witty . . . brilliant” (Cosmopolitan). At Vassar, they were known as “the group”—eight young women of privilege, the closest of friends, an eclectic mix of vibrant personalities. A week after graduation in 1933, they all gather for the wedding of Kay Strong, one of their own, before going their separate ways in the world. In the years that follow, they will each know accomplishment and loss in equal measure, pursuing careers and marriage, experiencing the joys and traumas of sexual awakening and motherhood, all while suffering through betrayals, infidelities, and sometimes madness. Some of them will drift apart. Some will play important roles in the personal dramas of others. But it is tragedy that will ultimately unite the group once again. A novel that stunned the world when it was first published in 1963, Mary McCarthy’s The Group found acclaim, controversy, and a place atop the New York Times bestseller list for nearly two years for its frank and controversial exploration of women’s issues, social concerns, and sexuality.

Of course, an opinion is just that, but after just having read Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosnay I had felt so frustrated and angry, no, not by what the French police had done to Sarah's family, but by the badness of the book (and I suspect of the evil commercial intentions of Tatiana), my faith in Literature was reconfirmed, and my soul was patched, by this masterpiece by Mary McCarthy.",2013,en

At the end of the first book I eagerly looked forward to the second in the series, but was surprised to find that the publishers had decided to go with another narrator. Examining the rest of the series I saw that they kept switching narrators around as if they really don't care about a sense of continuity. Even though these audio-books are way overpriced I went ahead and purchased Stone of Tears. What a mistake! Jim Bond has a voice and diction that I can only compare to a 90's computer voice synthesizer. His style of narration is flat and boring with no flare whatsoever. Even though the story is great, I find myself dreading the next book and may just drop the whole series and go back to print. Its to bad that the publishers really don't care what the listening audience thinks about their books or they would ""audition"" the narrators before giving them the projects, not to mention keeping the same narrator for the entire series.

Exodus from Obesity: 2nd Edition,"Are you beaten by obesity? No. there is always hope, no matter how long you’ve suffered from it. No matter what damage has occurred. We have the God-given right to improve our lot in life. Having battled lifetime obesity, Marsha Miller lost approximately 100 pounds, beginning during middle age, by finally following a sensible path. It took eleven years to change from living at morbidly obese levels with health concerns, to living at a reasonable weight and in the best physical condition of her life. Knowing that she was constantly improving her body, rather than dieting, erased all excuses to alter her direction. Obesity’s oppression not only robs us of physical enjoyment, but steals our inner peace. Discovering peace within a healthy lifestyle is liberating! Many of the obese are simply “Slow Losers/Fast Gainers” who are frustrated by society’s imposed expectations for quick weight-loss results. This book shows that learning to make peace within an overall wellness process (enjoying the ride) fortifies confidence in our sense of self, improves general health at everyone’s starting level, and makes healthier weight management possible for everyone.

However, this book is wildly opinionated and often poorly justified. The author is demonstrably ignorant of topics outside of economics. Biology and climate science are particular weaknesses which are embarrassingly used in far too many examples. I have never classified myself as an environmentalist but when reading the author's anti-eco tirade I couldn't help wondering if this was a joke. It reads like the author and his friends, all paid-up Republican-voting supply-side economists, decided he should write a book that discredits all those nandy-pandy liberal ideas that are ruining America. If only, he argues, we had purer and freer markets everything would be fine. Every problem is the result of interference in the magic distribution of Smith's invisible hand. The author has clearly no idea of jurisprudence either. This is the key problem of the book. It's simply not rigorous in its justifications of sometimes outlandish-seeming claims, particularly improbable-seeming behavioral predictions. It's so flippant, you wonder whether you're supposed to take any assertion seriously.The result is a political manifesto masquerading as a book about economics. I accept that the two are related. As a political manifesto, it's not without its merits.

It deserves discussion along with Ender's Game, 2001, and maybe 2 or 3 others as candidates for the best of all time. Its effect on our culture is obvious, with ""grok"" becoming a word most people now recognize. (An Amazon search reveals nearly 400 other works that use the word ""grok."" How's that for influence.)Like most of the more in-depth reviews will state this, this novel is really like a play in two acts. The first half of the book is a masterpiece, and what places it amongst the great works. The 2nd half bogs down and meanders though. The first and second halves are different enough to make you think it's really two different stories.Without debating the merits of the themes on love in the 2nd half, the second half still would have been improved by a tighter focus, doing more with less.The first 1/2 of the book is the greatest couple of hundred pages of scifi ever, nothing compares. The 2nd half brings it down a little to the level of a few other greats, but it's still in select company.Everyone should read this. SciFi fan or not. I hope that one day it will be core reading for most 20th century literature courses, and included with great works outside of the scifi genre.",2014,en

The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of J.R.R. Tolkien’s epic adventure The Lord of the Rings. One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. Sauron, the Dark Lord, has gathered to him all the Rings of Power—the means by which he intends to rule Middle-earth. All he lacks in his plans for dominion is the One Ring—the ring that rules them all—which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care.

WRONG! The Hobbit was pretty decent; I finished that in a few days. Then I started Fellowship. After 150 pages I couldn't take it anymore! I put it back in the box and forgot about it. I made a second attempt a year later, but only made it to page 50. I am now on my third attempt and I am GOING to finish it this time because it's driving me MAD.Now, it's not that it's not a good story. I respect Tolkien for his imagination and creativity. You can tell that he put his whole soul into this book and you can't bash someone's soul (reason for the 3 stars...), but clearly, not everybody's souls match up, so to speak. Personally, I like to feel a certain degree of empathy for characters in a story. I don't care how many leaves the 52nd tree to the north has, but I would like care about the characters. This book leaves you identifying more with topography and three page long descriptions of sunsets and such than with the characters. And I don't understand what the deal with the songs are. I hope they aren't that important because I just skip them. Derry dol, Merry dol, who cares? Jeez.Obviously, there are people who like this book, and if you're the type of person who likes to be given vast descriptions of things for the neurons in your brain to construct, then you should get this. Maybe you will even feel something for the characters. Everyone's different, otherwise this book would be as beloved as it is. If you would rather read something that moves you and stirs empathy, then go for something else.I haven't said anything new, but I need to suggestion this: I made assumptions and wasted $30 on a boxed set that I will probably never finish. PLEASE don't buy the boxed set! Just buy the first book to see if you like it, and then if you don't, you won't feel OBLIGED to read them like I do. (I guess I just have OCD or something.

On Beauty,"Aquinas on Beauty explores the nature and role of beauty in the thought of Thomas Aquinas. Beginning with a standard definition of beauty provided by Aquinas, it explores each of the components of that definition. The result is a comprehensive account of Aquinas’s formal view on the subject, supplemented by an exploration into Aquinas’s commentary on Dionysius’s Divine Names, including a comparison of his views with those of both Dionysius and those of Aquinas’s mentor, Albert the Great. The book also highlights the tight connection in Aquinas’s thought between aesthetics and ethics, and illustrates how Aquinas preserves what is best about aesthetic traditions preceding him, and anticipates what is best about aesthetic traditions that would follow, marrying objective and subjective aesthetic intuitions and charting a kind of via media between the common extremes.",['Christopher Scott Sevier'],Lexington Books,2015-02-12,['Philosophy'],B000N76XWY,A1QI02D4XP6FKQ,4/6,4.0,1155859200,"Compulsively enjoyable, if a little superficial","I'm quite surprised by the negative reviews here- I found this book absolutely compulsive- its full of great dialogue, witty descriptions and is, at times, laugh out loud funny. The funniest part I remember is when Howard is at an academic dinner, and nearly wets himself because a barber-shop quartet are singing U2's In The Name of Love- in a samba style, complete with an impromptu moonwalk. That, alone, nearly had me in tears.I notice that many of the reviews are critical of Smith's use of dialogue, and her portrayal of black Americans such as Howard's wife Kiki. Being from Britain I can't comment on this, but I personally found the dialogue snappy and convincing, and Kiki to be a warm and empathetic character (and, unlike one of the nuttier reviewers, I didnt worry about why Zadie Smith didnt elaborate on the myriad of potential medical conditions which Kiki's 250 pound weight would entail. This is fiction, after all.)Many other reviewers complain that there is no plot. This is true, but because there is such a complex tangle of relationships throughout the book, this simply isn't an issue- in fact, it zips along beautifully. This novel isnt meant to be a fast-paced thriller- it's a study of human relationships. But it is perhaps here that the critics are on to something. For if I were to criticise On Beauty, its that the characters, while being interesting and recognisable, are rather stereotypical. Anyone who's been to university will recognise the clever but overly-eager Zora, or the hippy poetry teacher Claire. But Smith doesn't do enough to develop them. In fact, the characters fit rather too neatly into the reader's expectations. The characters Howard and Monty Kipps, exemplify this- the former a pretentious left-wing intellectual who's not much good at coping with reality, the latter a hypocritical right-wing ideologue. So far, so predictable. But Smith never really problematises this- the Kipps family in particular just weren't developed much beyond their hard-line Christian values. (Although the one exception to this is Kiki's touchingly brief friendship with Monty's wife, Carlene). This rather superficial charcaterisation is both On Beauty's strength, and its weakness. Its strength, in that it caters to its audience very well- if you're middle-class and university-educated, or have a literary inclination, you will revel in this novel's jokes about intellectuals and student life, etc. But the responses of some of the reviews posted here prove that not everyone was enamoured by Smith's potrayal of race relations, or minority ethnic groups.When you enjoy a book as much as I enjoyed reading this one, you do ask yourself if there's something suspicious about its being too readily appealing. And I think that the criticism above accounts for that. Perhaps, in trying to deal with large, thorny issues, Smith has bitten off more than she can chew, and has skimmed the surface as a result. However, had Smith undertaken a more thorough and complex exploration of these issues, the result would have been a much weighter piece of literature, but a far less enjoyable read.",2015,en
Experimental and quasi-experimental designs for research,"We shall examine the validity of 16 experimental designs against 12 common threats to valid inference. By experiment we refer to that portion of research in which variables are manipulated and their effects upon other variables observed. It is well to distinguish the particular role of this chapter. It is not a chapter on experimental design in the Fisher (1925, 1935) tradition, in which an experimenter having complete mastery can schedule treatments and measurements for optimal statistical efficiency, with complexity of design emerging only from that goal of efficiency. Insofar as the designs discussed in the present chapter become complex, it is because of the intransigency of the environment: because, that is, of the experimenter’s lack of complete control.","['Donald T.

First Salute Pb,"George Brydges Rodney (1718-1792), later Admiral Lord Rodney, had anything but a conventional career. His promising early career, which left him marked for advancement, had run into the sand during the long years of peace after the Seven Years War (1756-1763). Indeed when Britain and France found themselves at war again in 1778 as a result of the latter's support for the American colonists, Rodney had exiled himself in France to escape his creditors. It was only due to he generosity of a French nobleman that he was able to return to England.The main emphasis of this work is on Rodney's final two years of active service as Commander-in-Chief of the Leeward Islands during the closing stages of the American War of Independence Of the 21 enemy ships of the line captured or destroyed by the Royal Navy during the whole of that War, Rodney accounted for 15. His years of glory culminated in the defeat of the Comte de Grasse's fleet at the Battle of the Saintes fought off Dominica on 12 April 1782, where he famously broke the French line.Despite his undoubted fighting qualities, Rodney was a hard superior and difficult subordinate. His aloof and autocratic character won him few friends and he was also accused of letting his desire for prize money cloud his professional judgment. But there is no question that his prowess inspired others , not least Nelson himself.For a better understanding of both this complex character and maritime history during the American War of Independence, Rodney and the Breaking of the Line can be strongly recommended.(First published as a hardback in 2006 by Pen & Sword Military)",['Peter Trew'],eBook Partnership,2013-08-12,['Biography & Autobiography'],1842121774,A371V61LDBBSFW,2/3,2.0,1178323200,Is a bad Tuchman still worth reading?,"A tour guide at Williamsburg recommended this as 'essential' reading and since I had enjoyed Tuchman's ""A Distant Mirror"" I was ready for a good book.

A smart, funny, gorgeous retelling starring all characters of color. Zuri Benitez has pride. Brooklyn pride, family pride, and pride in her Afro-Latino roots. But pride might not be enough to save her rapidly gentrifying neighborhood from becoming unrecognizable. When the wealthy Darcy family moves in across the street, Zuri wants nothing to do with their two teenage sons, even as her older sister, Janae, starts to fall for the charming Ainsley. She especially can’t stand the judgmental and arrogant Darius. Yet as Zuri and Darius are forced to find common ground, their initial dislike shifts into an unexpected understanding. But with four wild sisters pulling her in different directions, cute boy Warren vying for her attention, and college applications hovering on the horizon, Zuri fights to find her place in Bushwick’s changing landscape, or lose it all.

Perhaps my less-than-perfect rating is due to the discrepancy between my expectations and what was delivered, but I found that Dune lacked a overall cohesiveness that would have merited it the fifth star. There were points where the novel seemed to teeter on the edge of something greater, but the potential was never fulfilled and the work would quickly steer clear of whatever larger goal it had glimpsed.The barren landscape which Herbert depicts is very real in its harsh cruelties, and I doubt that anyone could dispute Herbert's ability to render an entire world and a related existence with such precision. However, I found his characters devoid of that which gave his landscape such life, almost paling in comparison to the grand events and environment sweeping around them page after page. They seemed less human than pawns of fate, even Paul with all his power; perhaps that is Herbert's point, but not one I felt it was necessary to sacrifice character quality to prove.The greatest flaw of the work was my lack of belief, in both the characters and events. I believe the greatest sign of a work to be the level in which one can relate, or even believe in the reality, the truth which the author presents. I felt incredibly distant from the events I read, unable to suspend my disbelief even momentarily. I felt that the story was repetitive, cycling within the same limited confines, and even the the magnitude of the ending did not seem a release. Although the end of the novel is a far cry from what the reader could imagine at the beginning, the story lacked a quality that made me believe. I gave it four stars only because of the quality of the author's writing, and because I can see the potential effect of such a work for other readers even if I am unable to experience it myself.Perhaps I should temper my critique with a confession, however. When this book was recommended to me, it was compared to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. I read it in anticipation of what I had read and so enjoyed in Tolkien's work, only to be disappointed when I realized that it was nothing similar. Perhaps had I read it without any preconceptions, I would be able to appreciate Herbert's work on its own merits. Unfortunately, I found myself comparing it to the fantasy trilogy, resulting in the review you read above. I am more a fantasy-fiction lover than one of science fiction, which gives me a definite bias. If you like science fiction then by all means, I highly recommend this book as one of the watersheds of modern science fiction.",2021,en

At this point it is important to note that these same wheels could not have been made without metal tools. From early Neolithic times on gold was a favorite choice in the making of jewelry. During the Neolithic period these ""shining stones,"" probably alluvial, were prized. Actually gold was cold worked as if it were a stone. There is a surviving example of cold-worked gold from Catahuyuk (present day Turkey) estimated to have been made in 6500 B. C. There were only four metals on the earth's surface that were found in sufficient quantity to be used: gold, copper, silver, and meteoric iron. An understanding of the malleability of gold, and of the annealing effect of fire, changed jewelry making; new forms were found.

This early work by Lucy Maud Montgomery was originally published in 1939 and we are now republishing it with a brand new introductory biography. Lucy Maud Montgomery was born on 30th November 1874, New London, in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island. Her mother, Clara Woolner (Macneil), died before Lucy reached the age of two and so she was raised by her maternal grandparents in a family of wealthy Scottish immigrants. In 1908 Montgomery produced her first full-length novel, titled 'Anne of Green Gables'. It was an instant success, and following it up with several sequels, Montgomery became a regular on the best-seller list and an international household name. Montgomery died in Toronto on 24th April 1942.",['Lucy Maud Montgomery'],Read Books Ltd,2015-04-24,['Young Adult Fiction'],B0007CC3GU,A2SJ6ULDW7PPZ8,2/4,2.0,1273190400,Why is this novel so dull?,"I thoroughly enjoyed Anne of Green Gables, but Anne of Avonlea is devoid of all that made the first lively and captivating.

Instead we are bludgeoned over the head with narrative bucolic scenery after narrative bucolic scenery. Gone is the tension between Anne and Gilbert and gone is the hilarity of Anne's growing pains, and no sympathy is created for the twins Anne and Marilla have adopted.

We Die Alone,"We Die Alone recounts one of the most exciting escape stories to emerge from the challenges and miseries of World War II. In March 1943, a team of expatriate Norwegian commandos sailed from northern England for Nazi-occupied arctic Norway to organize and supply the Norwegian resistance. But they were betrayed and the Nazis ambushed them. Only one man survived--Jan Baalsrud. This is the incredible and gripping story of his escape.Frostbitten and snowblind, pursued by the Nazis, he dragged himself on until he reached a small arctic village. He was near death, delirious, and a virtual cripple. But the villagers, at mortal risk to themselves, were determined to save him, and--through impossible feats--they did.We Die Alone is an astonishing true story of heroism and endurance.

The writing is good and descriptive, and is only occasionally confusing. Overall this is a really good story with believable events. Worth reading.FULL REVIEW: The escape story does not actually begin until about the third chapter but the story of a planned sabotage keeps your attention until then. Once he escapes off on his own it is not long before he runs into people who help him out. The escape story is made somewhat less amazing because of this, only because he does not survive with his own planning and strength. The story relies on the help of others throughout the whole escape. But what he endures and gets away with and what people do to sneak him to safety is what makes this a good story. There is constant action and continual tension of whether he will get caught, all of which makes it worth reading.",2016,en
Crazy for You,"A psychologist and bestselling author redefines love and sex addiction as a spectrum disorder, and offers a new approach for healing. For anyone who has wondered Why does everyone else seem to be able to make romantic relationships work, and I can’t? What’s wrong with me? Why is love so hard? Psychologist and bestselling memoirist Kerry Cohen is all too familiar with the questions she often hears from her clients—and has asked herself. Even though sex and love are some of the most universal, sought-after experiences we have, many of us lack the tools and understanding to approach them in a healthy way. Without knowing it, many people struggling with sex and love actually fall somewhere on the spectrum of sex and love addiction (SLA). Sex and love addiction is still wildly misunderstood. It’s shrouded in secrecy and shame, and many counselors lack the training to address it—leaving people who need help without resources. Yet SLA isn’t a binary of you are or you aren’t, rather, it’s a spectrum. Kerry Cohen knows this all too well as both a therapist and someone who identifies on the SLA spectrum. Based on research and her own clinical experience, Crazy for You dives into SLA and provides an inclusive framework for understanding relationships, along with practical exercises and advice for self-assessment, discovery, and healing: Part one explains the sex and love addiction spectrum, helping you determine where you fall on it and how you got there Part two introduces strategies for breaking the spell of sex and love addiction, like behavior modifications and self-awareness techniques Part three teaches you how to navigate healthy, safe, and fulfilling relationships",['Kerry Cohen'],Hachette UK,2021-09-21,['Self-Help'],0330426478,A2MH45450030H0,0/0,5.0,1329523200,"A comedy about a stalker?

From the New York Times–bestselling author of The Excellent Lombards and A Map of the World, this is “an extraordinary story of a family’s disintegration [that] will be compared to Jane Smiley’s A Thousand Acres” (People). It follows Ruth Grey, a young woman in a tiny Illinois farm town, who has lost her father to World War II, and constantly faces her unhappy mother’s wrath—when she isn’t being ignored in favor of her math-prodigy brother. As Ruth navigates her lonely life, she strives to find happiness and pleasure where she can, but the world may conspire to defeat her. “A sly and wistful, if harrowing, human comedy . . .

Ramona,"Ramona (1884) is a novel by Helen Hunt Jackson. Inspired by her activism for the rights of Native Americans, Ramona is a story of racial discrimination, survival, and history set in California in the aftermath of the Mexican American War. Immensely popular upon publication, Ramona earned favorable comparisons to Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin and remains an influential sentimental novel to this day. Orphaned after the death of her foster mother, Ramona, a Scottish-Native American girl, is taken in by her reluctant foster aunt Señora Gonzaga Moreno. Early on, she experiences discrimination due to her mixed heritage and troubled upbringing, but Gonzaga Moreno begrudgingly provides for her as though she were her own daughter, in accordance with her sister’s wishes. When a group of Native American migrant workers arrives from Temecula to perform the annual sheep shearing, Ramona falls in love with Alessandro, a pious Catholic. Despite his honesty and capacity for hard work, Alessandro is viewed with contempt by the Señora. Faced with no alternative, the lovers elope and make their way toward the San Bernardino Mountains, facing racism and violence from American settlers along the way. Bound by love, rejected by the dominant cultures of the newly Americanized California, Alessandro and Ramona must do what they can to survive.

The main characters, Ramona and Alessandro, are ""fairy-tale-ized"", but their story still touches, and the book still has power. Helen Hunt Jackson purposely wrote ""Ramona"" to call attention to the U.S.'s unfair treatment of Native Americans, but the two essays included in the Signet edition claim that, for all the popularity of the novel, it didn't bring results.

1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus,"Hoe de wereld zich ontwikkelde na de ontdekking van Amerika De reizen van Columbus vormden het begin van een bijzondere uitwisseling van flora en fauna tussen Eurazië en Noord- en Zuid-Amerika. Zo vonden onder meer tomaten, aardappelen, maïs, zilver en rubber hun weg naar Eurazië, en omgekeerd zijde, paarden, graan, koffie, appels - en slaven niet te vergeten - naar Noord- en Zuid-Amerika. Een minder welkome uitwisseling was uiteraard die van insecten, bacteriën en virussen. Charles Mann laat zien dat deze zogeheten Columbian Exchange heeft gezorgd voor de opkomst van Europa, de ondergang van het Chinese keizerrijk en de verstoring van de ecologie in Afrika. Met 1493 heeft bestsellerauteur Charles Mann de belangrijkste biologische gebeurtenis sinds het uitsterven van de dinosauriërs onder de aandacht van een groot publiek weten te brengen.

Confessions of an Economic Hitman,"Shocking Bestseller: The original version of this astonishing tell-all book spent 73 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, has sold more than 1.25 million copies, and has been translated into 32 languages. New Revelations: Featuring 15 explosive new chapters, this expanded edition of Perkins's classic bestseller brings the story of economic hit men (EHMs) up to date and, chillingly, home to the US. Over 40 percent of the book is new, including chapters identifying today's EHMs and a detailed chronology extensively documenting EHM activity since the first edition was published in 2004. Former economic hit man John Perkins shares new details about the ways he and others cheated countries around the globe out of trillions of dollars. Then he reveals how the deadly EHM cancer he helped create has spread far more widely and deeply than ever in the US and everywhere else—to become the dominant system of business, government, and society today. Finally, he gives an insider view of what we each can do to change it. Economic hit men are the shock troops of what Perkins calls the corporatocracy, a vast network of corporations, banks, colluding governments, and the rich and powerful people tied to them. If the EHMs can't maintain the corrupt status quo through nonviolent coercion, the jackal assassins swoop in. The heart of this book is a completely new section, over 100 pages long, that exposes the fact that all the EHM and jackal tools—false economics, false promises, threats, bribes, extortion, debt, deception, coups, assassinations, unbridled military power—are used around the world today exponentially more than during the era Perkins exposed over a decade ago. The material in this new section ranges from the Seychelles, Honduras, Ecuador, and Libya to Turkey, Western Europe, Vietnam, China, and, in perhaps the most unexpected and sinister development, the United States, where the new EHMs—bankers, lobbyists, corporate executives, and others—“con governments and the public into submitting to policies that make the rich richer and the poor poorer.” But as dark as the story gets, this reformed EHM also provides hope. Perkins offers a detailed list of specific actions each of us can take to transform what he calls a failing Death Economy into a Life Economy that provides sustainable abundance for all.",['John Perkins'],Berrett-Koehler Publishers,2016-02-09,['Biography & Autobiography'],B0009JKV7E,A1GW4RE1XOI19N,13/18,2.0,1168646400,You're not confessing...You're bragging.,"All the time I was reading this book I couldn't help but think of that old confession joke.

So much so I believe I uttered an incredulous ""Oh come on!"" at least once a chapter.What really nailed it home for me was the Epilogue. It felt like when C. Montgomery Burns wrote his autobiography (Will There Ever be a Rainbow?). In his epilogue Mr. Burns comments about how much the reader enjoyed reading his book. An assumption inspired by the author's ego rather than the story. Perkins assumes it too. He writes as if everyone who read the book was ""moved"" by it. I was moved, but moved to laughter. It just proved to me that this was not his confession but his bragging.I give it two stars because some of the stuff in was interesting. However, I would not recommend it to a friend.",2016,en

Lord of the Flies,"William Golding’s unforgettable classic of boyhood adventure and the savagery of humanity comes to Penguin Classics in a stunning Graphic Deluxe Edition with a new foreword by Lois Lowry As provocative today as when it was first published in 1954, Lord of the Flies continues to ignite passionate debate with its startling, brutal portrait of human nature.

"Patriarchy at Work: Patriarchal and Capitalist Relations in Employment, 1800-1984 (Feminist Perspectives from Polity Press)","The concept of 'patriarchy' is one which signals a sharp divide between traditions of feminist thought. Sylvia Walby attempts to conceptualize 'patriarchy' in a way that takes account not only of the complexity of relationships of gender, but also of the subtleties of the interconnections of patriarchy and capitalism. She rejects those accounts which treat patriarchy as a unified set of relations, or which confine the site of patriarchy to any one privileged sphere such as the family. Instead, she elaborates a novel view of patriarchy as a set of 'relatively autonomous relations', the connections between which are spelled out through a variety of detailed case studies. In contrast to many other views of 'capitalist patriarchy', Sylvia Walby characterizes the relationship between capitalism and patriarchy as a relationship, not of harmony and mutual accommodation, but of tension and conflict. This thesis is substantiated through a comparative historical analysis of three contrasting areas of employment: cotton textiles, engineering and clerical work. These analyses show the shortcomings of much conventional literature in sociology, history and economics on women's employment, which pays insufficient attention to the independence of patriarchal relations. The book draws upon sociological, historical, economic and geographic materials to argue for an understanding of gender relations in terms of the specific tensions and compromises between patriarchal and capitalist relations. Exploring the impact of the state on patterns of employment and unemployment completes a book rich in theoretical and empirical analysis. Patriarchy at Work will be recognized as a major contribution to feminist thought and the social sciences.",['Sylvia Walby'],John Wiley & Sons,2013-05-20,['Social Science'],0745601588,AG35NEEFCMQVR,0/0,4.0,1088726400,Few written records from female workers,"Walby offers a sweeping analysis of patriarchy and gender inequality in industrial society. In one instance, she studies gender relations in employment from 1800 to 1914. In other words, virtually from the start of the Industrial Revolution.While women were always employed by factories, she points out that it is very difficult to find surviving written views of those women from the 1800s. At that time, universal literacy (including for girls) was still being introduced. So many of those women would have had limited literacy. And even then, writings were seen as the purview of the white collar classes. Walby describes well this paucity of female worker viewpoints. A reader might compare this to finding written testimonies by ex-slaves in the US from that same period.",2013,en

Above average mystery suspense. It kept my interest.,"TELL NO ONE by Harlan Coben.I loved the Tyree parts. He was a black drug dealer. His was the best part of the story but only a small part. I was intrigued with Eric Wu. I had not read about a thug with his talents before.My problem was the author using slight of hand or gimmicks rather than substantive suspense. Examples follow.1. A few times conversations were drawn out to delay suspense for a couple of minutes. It was artificial. For example, A has a question and meets with B to ask it. Instead of asking the question right away, A talks about other things or asks other questions before finally getting around to the main question. Or, A wants to tell something to B but beats around the bush with other comments before getting to it. It bothered me because if I were the character, I would have said the thing right away instead of beating around the bush.2. Two guys are in a car. If I were one of the guys, I would have said or asked things that he did not. His silence allowed an interesting twist to be revealed a few minutes later. It was convenient for the author, not logical for the reader.3. I like twists and surprises but the main twist was hard to believe. A loving couple kept secrets from each other, which were the kind of secrets a loving couple would not keep from each other. But that was the basis for the book.The overall result is a decent mystery story. But my problems were linked to characters' actions not fitting their motivations.The narrator Ed Sala was very good. I liked the way he paused. Some narrators don't pause enough.DATA:Narrative mode: David parts were 1st person. Other parts were 3rd person. This worked well.

He's about to die peacefully when he's kidnapped and rejuvenated and coerced to tell his memoirs. I could read stories about Lazarus' life for months, but unfortunately this book only contains two. The rest is action in the `present' (4272 Gregorian), and at the end, an account of Lazarus' trip back in time to visit his ""first family"" (parents, brothers and sisters, grandfather).This is the first of the last four books Heinlein wrote, and it was clear he was nearing the end of his life, looking mortality straight in the face and writing his fantasy of living forever. Lazarus shares his collected wealth of knowledge and wisdom, although he'd insist he's got nothing to say of any worth, and much of it is the best advice I've ever heard.Those not familiar with Heinlein might find his morals a little depraved, especially the more sexually straight-laced, although science fiction often contains stories of societies whose taboos are not our own, and would be scandalized by ours. The only complaint I have about the book is how annoying that is that certain parts are (omitted), then return to the story in the middle of the sentence. It's not smooth, and although the omissions are mostly for brevity's sake, I felt like I missed something important.

The way Patrick got out of all his legal troubles was not very realistic but fascinating escapist fare nonetheless. The ending seemed as though he couldn't come up with something better or couldn't decide how to end the story, so with no clues whatsoever along the way, he severed the story abruptly before it was due to end. A clue or two along the way would have made the same ending satisfying and believable, but to have a character suddenly become a totally different person in the last two pages of a book or else to have the character disappear altogether left me feeling duped and pissed off at the author for his lack of planning and feeling like he didn't really do his job all that well after all. With all the thought that went into this book to set up the elaborate plot, I think Grisham could have put a bit more thought into either creating a believable ending or leaving clues along the way.

"The Mathematical Career of Pierre de Fermat, 1601-1665","Hailed as one of the greatest mathematical results of the twentieth century, the recent proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles brought to public attention the enigmatic problem-solver Pierre de Fermat, who centuries ago stated his famous conjecture in a margin of a book, writing that he did not have enough room to show his ""truly marvelous demonstration."" Along with formulating this proposition--xn+yn=zn has no rational solution for n > 2--Fermat, an inventor of analytic geometry, also laid the foundations of differential and integral calculus, established, together with Pascal, the conceptual guidelines of the theory of probability, and created modern number theory. In one of the first full-length investigations of Fermat's life and work, Michael Sean Mahoney provides rare insight into the mathematical genius of a hobbyist who never sought to publish his work, yet who ranked with his contemporaries Pascal and Descartes in shaping the course of modern mathematics.",['Michael Sean Mahoney'],Princeton University Press,2018-06-05,['Science'],0691036667,ABXL7LCYHY3BV,10/10,5.0,981417600,Mathematics in transition: Pierre de Fermat,"Thanks to the widely publicized proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles, there is a growing public interest in the 17th- century mathematician and his famous theorem. However, readers interested in the theorem and its history should look elsewhere as this book is directed towards the history and the transition of mathematics as a science in the 17th century. Studying the evolution of concepts and methods in mathematics, Michael Mahony sets a standard with this excellent work. A student of Thomas Kuhn, Mahony is meticulous in his treatment and interpretation of historical data about Fermat within its historical context. He is very careful in the use of notational systems and at appropriate times he uses the same symbolism as Fermat used in his correspondence with Mersenne and others. These subtleties are important as the evolution in algebraic symbolism has precisely been functional in the foundation of analytic geometry. Further in line with Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions Mahony first situates Pierre de Fermat within Vi&egrave;te's analytic program and continuously refers to this program of scientific research. He clearly shows where Fermat departs from this program and lays the foundation of something new as with number theory as a discipline on its own.The career of Pierre de Fermat coincides with an important revolution within mathematics during the 17th century: together with Descartes he fundamentally altered the balance between the visual and the abstract in mathematics. The Greek tradition of visually stating problems about curves, loci and triangles gave way to an abstract characterization in algebraic equations which allowed a more general treatment of these original problems. Where the Greek tradition provided the starting point for Fermat, he moved that far beyond his original sources that by the end of his carreer the original Greek texts became history for mathematicians.However, the book is even more than an illustration of science in transition: it reveals the mathematician in transition. The author is very convincing in recreating step by step the way Fermat arrived at new ideas and theorems and how, over time, he became the father of new disciplines in mathematics. Mahony does so by reconstructing all the conceptual steps needed in arriving at new ideas. For the method of maxima and minima, the doctrine of tangents and the quadrature, he relies on available historical data, such as Fermat's letters to Mersenne, Descartes and Frenicle. For Fermat's contributions on number theory however, only a few historical documents are available as Fermat was very secretive about his findings and reluctant to publish anything. With some help from Euler and Weil, Mahony shows very convincingly and fits together how theorems and proofs on number theory emerged over time for the man who was Pierre de Fermat.Everybody who is keen on mathematics and its history should read this book. Being an excellent case study of science in transition, the book will highly appeal to students in the philosophy of science.",2018,en

But, as luck would have it, George did discover something among the false claims and dead-end leads that made this into more than just another missing-heir-to-a vast-fortune case.

Pride & Prejudice (New Windmill),"In a timely update of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, National Book Award finalist Ibi Zoboi skillfully balances cultural identity, class, and gentrification against the heady magic of first love in her vibrant reimagining of this beloved classic. A smart, funny, gorgeous retelling starring all characters of color. Zuri Benitez has pride. Brooklyn pride, family pride, and pride in her Afro-Latino roots. But pride might not be enough to save her rapidly gentrifying neighborhood from becoming unrecognizable. When the wealthy Darcy family moves in across the street, Zuri wants nothing to do with their two teenage sons, even as her older sister, Janae, starts to fall for the charming Ainsley. She especially can’t stand the judgmental and arrogant Darius. Yet as Zuri and Darius are forced to find common ground, their initial dislike shifts into an unexpected understanding. But with four wild sisters pulling her in different directions, cute boy Warren vying for her attention, and college applications hovering on the horizon, Zuri fights to find her place in Bushwick’s changing landscape, or lose it all. ""Zoboi skillfully depicts the vicissitudes of teenage relationships, and Zuri’s outsize pride and poetic sensibility make her a sympathetic teenager in a contemporary story about race, gentrification, and young love."" (Publishers Weekly, ""An Anti-Racist Children's and YA Reading List"")",['Ibi Zoboi'],HarperCollins,2018-09-18,['Young Adult Fiction'],0435126075,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,2/2,5.0,1285372800,"His pride, her prejudice","""Pride and Prejudice"" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (""I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine""). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (""No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting"").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (""Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do"").Despite its mildly stuffy style, ""Pride and Prejudice"" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read.",2018,en
"Wrestling With Angels: What Genesis Teaches Us About Our Spiritual Identity, Sexuality and Personal Relationships","Wrestling with Angels For over twenty years, psychotherapist, lecturer, and Bible teacher Naomi H. Rosenblatt has been leading some of the nation's best and brightest minds through the Bible, from Wall Street boardrooms to weekly sessions in the U.S. Congress, in what William Safire has called ""the best Bible class for the layman."" Drawing upon insights into human nature gleaned from decades of private practice and a lifelong study of the Bible, she sifts through the Bible's epic stories, filled with vivid characters in dramatic circumstances, to show how the lessons of their lives empower us today as parents, spouses, businesspeople, citizens, and lovers. In Wrestling with Angels, she and her co-author Joshua Horwitz retell and interpret the multigenerational saga of the first family of the Bible, showing how their all-too-human struggles are decidedly relevant to the issues confronting us today. The Bible? Relevant today? Many readers will be surprised by how truly relevant the Book of Genesis is. It discusses, among other things, the first recorded case of sexual harassment; surrogate parenting and the problems it raises; siblings battling over the love of a parent; rape and its consequences; and vigilante justice. The issues faced by Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, and their descendants are remarkably similar to those that arise in all of our lives, including: The strenuous demands of adulthood The challenges of faith The joys of sexuality The nature of leadership and heroism The responsibilities of parenting The role of values in building character The empowerment of a spiritual identity In this extraordinary book of timeless and profound wisdom, Naomi Rosenblatt invites both Christians and Jews to revisit our common spiritual heritage: ""For the humanist, the religious, the agnostic, or the merely inquisitive, Wrestling with Angels is an open invitation to probe the mystery, the miracle, and the drama of adult life in an imperfect world."" A book to be read again and again, Wrestling with Angels is a poignant and pragmatic guide to the bestselling self-help book of all time.","['Naomi H.

Wells' late 19th century conceptualization of the Heat-Ray (laser gun), Black Smoke (chemical warfare) and Secret of Flying (airplanes) correctly anticipates the direction of 20th century military technology. However, his descriptions of the brain-strong, emotion-free Martians, with their intricate though wheel-less machines and rapid-growth red creeper plants, today remain only imaginary, since prospects of extant advanced life on Mars are, by modern scientific judgment, whilst conceivable, strikingly remote.Wells' depiction of how humans commonly respond in disaster situations--initial nonchalance and controlled denial, followed by convulsive panic in the face of imminent death--is superb. Further, the juxtaposition of the narrator's courageous realism alongside the curate's wimpy fatalism and the artilleryman's dreamy idealism elevates the plot-oriented adventure to a stimulating, higher philosophical level.The ""good guy wins"" story remains suspenseful until the end because the means of victory (I'll just say ""by power of nature,"" to avoid revealing too much) is intriguing and believable. Regarding the title of the book, since the confrontation is limited geographically and involves a very restricted number of Martian invaders within the span of only a few weeks, a less grandiose title along the lines of ""Invasion of the Martians"" would be more true to the actual unfolding of events.The main weakness of the book as a literary work is the superficial development of the human relationships between key characters. The narrator's brother seems to be mostly a literary device used by the author to expose the reader to events outside of the narrator's immediate experience. Most importantly, the narrator's relationship to his wife begs further development, especially since she is the emotional driving force behind the narrator's lonely resolve to persevere through his struggles and, ultimately, return to her side.",2017,en

In the aftermath of the Cold War, US intelligence caught three high-profile Russian spies. However, these arrests left major questions unanswered, and rumours have long swirled of another mole, often referred to as the Fourth Man. Three pioneering female veterans of counterintelligence were tasked with unearthing him. With steadfast determination and expertise, they came to a shocking conclusion, one which had, and continues to harbour, dramatic consequences for American security. In this gripping insider account, Baer tells a thrilling story of Russian espionage and American intelligence. With profound implications for the rise of Vladimir Putin and international relations with Russia, The Fourth Man is a real-life spy thriller with echoes of John Le Carré.",['Robert Baer'],Hachette UK,2022-05-19,['Biography & Autobiography'],0861243684,A1S3C5OFU508P3,0/0,4.0,1110499200,A history of questionable actions by the CIA,"While all of the details will only slowly become public knowledge, it is clear that the CIA was incompetent in gathering intelligence about Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Furthermore, a recent news report stated that the intelligence gathered about the Iranian nuclear program was almost totally wrong. This should not surprise anyone who has paid attention to the history of the organization. In this book, which despite the title is largely about the American CIA rather than the Soviet KGB, you read about many of the ways the CIA has failed.Those failures started almost from the first day the organization existed. There were almost comical attempts to overthrow Enver Hoxha, the communist dictator of Albania. They failed to predict the North Korean invasion of South Korea and they completely overestimated the response of the Cuban people to the invasion of the island at the Bay of Pigs. Their assassination attempts against Fidel Castro were ridiculous and I still remember Senator Edward Kennedy laughing at some of their reported antics during the hearings conducted by the Church committee in the `70s.The CIA also completely failed to understand how weak the Shah's regime was in Iran and how hated his secret police were, which were largely trained by the CIA. His downfall, like that of the Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe was completely unanticipated.The years between 1946 and 1991 are generally called the Cold War, because the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union never reached the point where forces from both sides were shooting at each other. However, to the people in nearly every other place on Earth, the war was very real. We tend to think of the millions that were killed in Korea and Vietnam when exceptions are considered and this is due to the American involvement in those places.

I was disappointed by the numerous errors, lack of correlation between topics emphasized in the book and the actual exam questions, and problems with the included software.The book is riddled with errors. For example, there is an incorrect process name in the P.M. process matrix (pg 43); the text repeatedly confuse the PMBOK definition of ""quality"" with that of ""customer satisfaction"" (one example is on pg 92); there is a Prep Test question that states that the project plan is created during Initiation (pg 78); etc. Additionally, the software didn't run properly until I stumbled upon a patch Nathan and Jones had posted on their web site. Even after the software was patched, it still had runtime problems. Finally, having recently taken the exam, I note that my performance on their practice exam was not a good predictor of my actual exam score. Additionally, Nathan and Jones emphasized a number of topic that did not appear on the exam and gave scant attention to several topics that were emphasized.

It was my first fantasy series, aside from Narnia or whatever. I just liked those heroic tales about kings, princes, war, and swordfighting... I never felt comfort with other genres like science fiction, thrillers or horror.So I just stumbled on this book in the library, my first fantasy novel. You can imagine when I was sitting in my little room day and night, that cold winter 10 years ago, reading Tolkien's work. I finished the whole series in just two weeks. That day when I turned the last page of the third and last book ""The Return of the King"" I thought I wouldn't read any better series. I promised myself I would read them again another time... Easy cake right? So I thought...Years passed and I eventually became a better reader with tons of fantasy books on my backbone. Today I can tell what books is a great read and what books to stay away from. I tried to read TLOTR several times, and every time I did that I gave up in 24 hours no matter what edition I bought or how much motivated I was.Why was I giving up? Well... There aren't really much of a story in theese books, is it? I almost knew what was going to happen in every next page, except for how many leaves that tree in the next forest had of course. There isn't much happening in TLOTR and because of that I couldn't read it again a second time. Other fantasy series is very enjoyable, such as George RR Martin's ""A Song of Ice and Fire"", and you can reread it again and again without getting bored. But to me that's impossible when it comes to TLOTR even when I really wanted to, especially before the release of the excellent movies by Peter Jackson. Some Tolkien fan might mention that I should read the Hobbit or Silmarillion because it makes it easier. That might be true, but that's not my point, I mean that the story is too slow and not engaging enough after a while.In my opinion TLOTR is great if you never have read it before, but after that I don't think most of you'll be able to read it again unless you suffer from sever Alzheimer's and have forgotten everything or are a Real fan that can speak those Elven language and dress as a Hobbit like Peter Jackson :) ( Those Tolkien fans I have met acts more like a cult, if they saw me writing this review I would be found in a dark alley motionless).I know that that many authors ""copied"" Tolkien's world. Almost 89 percent of the fantasy books begin with the journy of a boy (Frodo) who will try to save the world from evil with the guidance of a mysterious hero (Gandalf or Aragorn).

It Can't Happen Here A Novel,"“The novel that foreshadowed Donald Trump’s authoritarian appeal.”—Salon It Can’t Happen Here is the only one of Sinclair Lewis’s later novels to match the power of Main Street, Babbitt, and Arrowsmith. A cautionary tale about the fragility of democracy, it is an alarming, eerily timeless look at how fascism could take hold in America. Written during the Great Depression, when the country was largely oblivious to Hitler’s aggression, it juxtaposes sharp political satire with the chillingly realistic rise of a president who becomes a dictator to save the nation from welfare cheats, sex, crime, and a liberal press. Called “a message to thinking Americans” by the Springfield Republican when it was published in 1935, It Can’t Happen Here is a shockingly prescient novel that remains as fresh and contemporary as today’s news.

Useful Idiots - How Liberals Got It Wrong in the Cold War and Still Blame America,"The original BESTSELLER from nationally syndicated columnist Mona Charen! Who’s on the wrong side of history? The liberals who are always willing to blame America first and defend its enemies. They've tried to rewrite history, but Mona Charen won't let them as she calls out liberal hypocrisy during the Cold War and afterward; from DC elites like Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, and Jimmy Carter to Hollywood celebs like Woody Allen, Jane Fonda, and Martin Sheen to academic snobs like Noam Chomsky, Susan Sontag, and many more.

She also worked on the campaign of Jack Kemp for president -- who's Jack Kemp?!Certainly he is no Al Gore. Just because she is a t.v. commentator on CNN (MY, that used to be Ted Turner's property, and he was once married to Jane Fonda!) doesn't give her any valid reason to call anyone &quot;idiots.&quot;I am not a liberal or left wing politically, but I believe the Rosenbergs were railroaded and lost their lives as a coverup for corruption of others. Ethel was guilty only of being a dedicated wife. Whittaker Chambers, it has been proven beyond a doubt, lied to save his own skin. He kept his distance from McCarthy because of his guilt and Communist inclinations.Alger Hiss, a high-ranking state department official, was much maligned and made a scapegoat, destroying his reputation. All for what, I ask. She lays blame where history has declared none existed. Restoring old, hurtful rumors only brings us all down.If Al Gore is a liberal, then I must be one as I believe in him. When Lott was called a racist, I told others I am more racist than he could ever be. How much intelligence does it take to be a secretary to a First Lady, I wonder.And to blaspheme Ed Asner is going too far.

Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library),"In a timely update of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, National Book Award finalist Ibi Zoboi skillfully balances cultural identity, class, and gentrification against the heady magic of first love in her vibrant reimagining of this beloved classic. A smart, funny, gorgeous retelling starring all characters of color. Zuri Benitez has pride. Brooklyn pride, family pride, and pride in her Afro-Latino roots. But pride might not be enough to save her rapidly gentrifying neighborhood from becoming unrecognizable. When the wealthy Darcy family moves in across the street, Zuri wants nothing to do with their two teenage sons, even as her older sister, Janae, starts to fall for the charming Ainsley. She especially can’t stand the judgmental and arrogant Darius. Yet as Zuri and Darius are forced to find common ground, their initial dislike shifts into an unexpected understanding. But with four wild sisters pulling her in different directions, cute boy Warren vying for her attention, and college applications hovering on the horizon, Zuri fights to find her place in Bushwick’s changing landscape, or lose it all. ""Zoboi skillfully depicts the vicissitudes of teenage relationships, and Zuri’s outsize pride and poetic sensibility make her a sympathetic teenager in a contemporary story about race, gentrification, and young love.""

The beautiful, intelligent, head strong Elizabeth Bennet has finally met her match in the arrogant, proud Mr. Darcy.

I however, believe that Ms. Austen was ahead of her time, exploring the world of gender politics with every witty heroine she created.Pride and Prejudice is a timeless tale that is just as enjoyable today as it was centuries ago.

"Check It While I Wreck It: Black Womanhood, Hip-Hop Culture, and the Public Sphere","Hip-hop culture began in the early 1970s as the creative and activist expressions -- graffiti writing, dee-jaying, break dancing, and rap music -- of black and Latino youth in the depressed South Bronx, and the movement has since grown into a worldwide cultural phenomenon that permeates almost every aspect of society, from speech to dress. But although hip-hop has been assimilated and exploited in the mainstream, young black women who came of age during the hip-hop era are still fighting for equality. In this provocative study, Gwendolyn D. Pough explores the complex relationship between black women, hip-hop, and feminism. Examining a wide range of genres, including rap music, novels, spoken word poetry, hip-hop cinema, and hip-hop soul music, she traces the rhetoric of black women ""bringing wreck."" Pough demonstrates how influential women rappers such as Queen Latifah, Missy Elliot, and Lil' Kim are building on the legacy of earlier generations of women -- from Sojourner Truth to sisters of the black power and civil rights movements -- to disrupt and break into the dominant patriarchal public sphere. She discusses the ways in which today's young black women struggle against the stereotypical language of the past (""castrating black mother,"" ""mammy,"" ""sapphire"") and the present (""bitch,"" ""ho,"" ""chickenhead""), and shows how rap provides an avenue to tell their own life stories, to construct their identities, and to dismantle historical and contemporary negative representations of black womanhood. Pough also looks at the ongoing public dialogue between male and female rappers about love and relationships, explaining how the denigrating rhetoric used by men has been appropriated by black women rappers as a means to empowerment in their own lyrics. The author concludes with a discussion of the pedagogical implications of rap music as well as of third wave and black feminism. This fresh and thought-provoking perspective on the complexities of hip-hop urges young black women to harness the energy, vitality, and activist roots of hip-hop culture and rap music to claim a public voice for themselves and to ""bring wreck"" on sexism and misogyny in mainstream society.",['Gwendolyn D. Pough'],Northeastern University Press,2015-12-01,['Social Science'],1555536077,A1P9SCS5VXQBOV,11/11,5.0,1090627200,Erudite and Culturally Relevant,"Throughout the history of Hip-Hop, its relationship with women (particularly Black women) and feminism has been strained. Though there have been a few success stories regarding women on the scene and behind the scenes of the Hip-Hop movement, women's place in it have been, for the most part, invisible, degrading, and kept to a minimum. In Gwendolyn's Pough's exciting new book, Check It While I Wreck It, the assistant professor of women's studies at the University of Minnesota examines the dysfunctional relationship between Black women, feminism, and Hip Hop.The book commences with a history of Black women in the public sphere who have contributed to the betterment of African-Americans such as Angela Davis, the historical Black clubwomen, and women who were trailblazers in the blues music industry. Pough reveals how Black women laid the foundation for future successes for the entire race. Pough writes ""Black women were major players through Reconstruction, the civil rights movement, and the Black Power movement."" In fact, because of their exclusion, the author even suggests a re-writing of history.Later the author gives us a more recent history of women's contributions to the arts and Hop, including Sylvia Robinson, the label owner of Sugar Hill Records, break dancer Baby Love, and female rapper Roxanne Shante. The book gives major props to Grammy-winner Queen Latifah, Sista Soulja, MC Lyte, and poet Jessica Care Moore.Pough also critiques the products of popular culture such as movies like Boyz N The Hood and Just Another Girl on the IRT, books such as Sista Soulja's The Coldest Winter Ever and Omar Tyree's Flyy Girl, and of course rap records such as L.L. Cool J's I Need Love, and Latifah's U.N.I.T.Y.The book is best when examining the problems that exist between women and Hip-Hop, from the objectification of women in music videos to the acts of hyper-sexual rappers such as Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown. Pough writes ""Today, in addition to the old images of the sexually promiscuous Black women...we have the bitches, hos, stunts, hoochies, pigeons, chickenheads, and baby mamas put forth by Black men rappers. The need to struggle against stereotyped images is still present."" Let's hope this book will keep the discussion that invokes change alive.""Check It While I Wreck"" is a thoroughly researched, erudite, and culturally relevant work that is virtually impossible to put down. Reminiscent of the writings of bell hooks, this scholarly work in feminist theory and Hip-Hop culture is destined to be an instant classic taught in college lecture halls across the country.",2015,en

No More Secrets, No More Lies unmasks the lies that have been employed to disempower the human race, while illuminating the tools necessary for those who intend to ascend with a revitalized Planet Earth. Intended as a guide for overcoming the designs of the dark warriors, and a blueprint for achieving the absolute freedom that is our true birthright as the super race of the realm, this provocative book brilliantly integrates into a larger schema such issues as media manipulation, racism, dark forces, crop circles, our food and water, and imminent extraterrestrial contacts, with the cosmic unfolding of human awareness and the evolutionary activation of our complex DNA codes our blueprint to immortality.",['Patricia Cori'],ReadHowYouWant,2012-06-01,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",8890104007,A2R4Z7MDMKRNH8,2/2,5.0,1308009600,"Are you worried about Dec. 21, 2012 - Read this book and find out the truth.","This book talks about our 9 dimensions of consciousness, and it's particularly relevant right now. It's an ideal book for anyone who's fearful of December 21, 2012. The media has hyped this date, and will no doubt only do it more as it approaches. The hype has made people, even people who don't even really know who the Mayans were, terrified because they now believe it's the date the world will end. Despite the many articles and papers that have been written disputing this and showing that the date only signifies the end of one of the many Mayan calendars (all of which have ended, often multiple times, and simply started again), people still persist with the idea that an apocalypse will occur on or around this date.But Mayan calendars are just like our calendars on one level. December 31st doesn't signify the end of the world, because the calendar always flips over to January 1st. Mayan calendars are the same, though they were used to measure different increments of time. The calendar ending in 2012 is a major calendar, but the date doesn't signify apocalypse. Rather, it signifies a change and a shift in human consciousness. The date should be seen as a positive date, the potential for a spiritual and mental awakening. That particular calendar simply starts again the next day, but the Mayans believed we may have achieved a higher consciousness then, a plane of better understanding and spiritual evolution.This book details this prophecy and can explain it in simple terms for those who are interested, and especially for those who are fearful. And it explains that the date the media parrots isn't really the date shift will occur--it will start two months earlier, and has the potential to bring about a deeper, universal understanding for those open to it. It's more accurate to think of it as a time of spiritual and conscious awakening than a time of global cataclysms.There is no such prophecy that predicts the horrors the media keep spouting about. The book was written 6 years ago, before the hype about 2012 began in earnest, which makes it particularly valuable. The book isn't just about this prophecy, however, but details the 9 dimensions of our consciousness and how each is vital to our survival and our evolution. This concept ties in with the prophecy, and can help people better understand how the Mayan prophecy really speaks of higher evolution and dimensional understandings instead of bleak and apocalyptic notions. Beyond the prophecy, it's an excellent volume for a better understanding of human consciousness and the concept of multiple dimensions.",2012,en

In my mind, he's that good -- he is one of the only writers that I am consistenly incapable of setting down to go to sleep... I finished the last half of &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; at about 5:00 am -- I was so wrapped up in it, that I failed to notice the time. Alas. Now, as for that review...IF YOU HAVEN'T READ ANY CHANDLER, you should stop reading this and go take a look at his first Marlowe novel, The Big Sleep. It's worthwhile to read them in order, or at the least, to read that one first... you'll get a good feeling for whether or not you like Marlowe, and you'll learn a bit more about him. Then, if you like that, come back and take another look at this review.IF YOU HAVE READ OTHER CHANDLER, then you already know, to some degree, what you're in for. You know Chandler's style, and I can promise you that this book offers up more of it, in abundance. I was a little thrown off for the first 50-some pages, because Marlowe has moved out of his trademark apartment and into a small house in a quiet residential neighborhood, and that didn't jive with me... but it works. Marlowe is, in his way, maturing. (If you've read his unfinished final work, Poodle Springs, then you know Marlowe will eventually get married. Perhaps this evolution says as much about Chandler as about his beloved P.I.)Once the plot starts moving, of course, you're just along for the ride. Like all Marlowe novels, you have that perfect feeling of riding shotgun in the mind and conscience of a fascinating and well-developed character, and it's enough to sustain you through WHATEVER Chandler cares to write about. But, as I said, this is Vintage (no pun intended) Chandler -- some of his best work. Like several other books of his, I would give it more than 5 stars if I could, because nothing he wrote deserves less. The plot develops in three acts, which seem unrelated until he begins to pull them together, and when he does so, it is nothing less than amazing to behold. (I thought I was outguessing him, and knew what was going to happen. Stupid me -- he was still three steps ahead of me, and I had egg all over my face when I was done with the last page. I love him for that.)If you're a mystery fan, or even a fan of good stylistic writing, this is some of the best stuff you could hope for. Call it pulp if you like, and say that Hammett outsold him if you must, but for my money, Chandler had more style than anyone else who's ever tackled the genre. Marlowe remains one of the best, most complete, and most enjoyable creations of literature that I have ever found, and I only wish that Chandler had left us more of him. *sigh*BOTTOM LINE: If you haven't read this one yet, I envy you.

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are serious, debilitating conditions that affect millions of people in the United States and around the world. ME/CFS can cause significant impairment and disability. Despite substantial efforts by researchers to better understand ME/CFS, there is no known cause or effective treatment. Diagnosing the disease remains a challenge, and patients often struggle with their illness for years before an identification is made. Some health care providers have been skeptical about the serious physiological - rather than psychological - nature of the illness. Once diagnosed, patients often complain of receiving hostility from their health care provider as well as being subjected to treatment strategies that exacerbate their symptoms. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome proposes new diagnostic clinical criteria for ME/CFS and a new term for the illness - systemic exertion intolerance disease(SEID). According to this report, the term myalgic encephalomyelitis does not accurately describe this illness, and the term chronic fatigue syndrome can result in trivialization and stigmatization for patients afflicted with this illness. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome stresses that SEID is a medical - not a psychiatric or psychological - illness. This report lists the major symptoms of SEID and recommends a diagnostic process.One of the report's most important conclusions is that a thorough history, physical examination, and targeted work-up are necessary and often sufficient for diagnosis. The new criteria will allow a large percentage of undiagnosed patients to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate care. Beyond Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome will be a valuable resource to promote the prompt diagnosis of patients with this complex, multisystem, and often devastating disorder; enhance public understanding; and provide a firm foundation for future improvements in diagnosis and treatment.","['Institute of Medicine', 'Board on the Health of Select Populations', 'Committee on the Diagnostic Criteria for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome']",National Academies Press,2015-03-16,['Medical'],0060922605,A1VBIZQW14N3VO,19/19,5.0,980208000,This book was a tremendous help,"I was diagnosed with Epstein-Barr 6 years ago at the age of 22.

The Awakening,"The Awakening, originally titled A Solitary Soul, is a novel by Kate Chopin, first published in 1899. Set in New Orleans and on the Louisiana Gulf coast at the end of the 19th century, the plot centers on Edna Pontellier and her struggle between her increasingly unorthodox views on femininity and motherhood with the prevailing social attitudes of the turn-of-the-century American South.",['Kate Chopin'],Lulu.com,2016-07-04,['Fiction'],093949583X,ACZWPFSQMK0YX,28/30,5.0,978134400,quietly submersed,"Kate Chopin's &quot;The Awakening&quot; is the classic novel about women that &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; purports to be but isn't. It's not just a &quot;woman's&quot; novel, though, it perfectly (and poetically) captures the inner life of a solitary person who is forced to live for the sake of others. And while this has been a distinctly female position for a large part of Western history, it is a position that can be identified with by just about anyone in our current age of employee internet-use monitoring. This is a twentieth-century tale of discomfort with and reaction to antagonistic surroundings. For those of us who don't feel the need to procreate in an overpopulated world, Edna's (and presumably Chopin's) discomfort with children will make sense. For those of us who may not always know exactly what we want out of life, this story will strike a chord.Kate Chopin's writing is deliberate but not labored. She is particularly successful at depicting ambiguity in a way which is highly descriptive and communicative. This is a skill which I can't praise highly enough, and it culminates in an ending which is absolutely perfect. While criticism could be raised against &quot;The Awakening&quot; as another apology for the suicidal artist, Edna's literal and symbolic escape is less pretentious than Harry's in &quot;Steppenwolfe,&quot; nor as indecipherable as that of any of Joyce's creations. Kate Chopin's novel is truly a classic in the sense that it should be a part of any survey of American literature. The Norton Critical edition is the best way to go, too, with helpful biographical information and literary criticism. If you want a more enriching experience with this novel, I'd highly recommend this version.",2016,en
Controversies and Commanders of the Civil War: Dispatches from the Army of the Potomac,"An in-depth look at the Union force that went up against Robert E. Lee, from “a master storyteller and leading Civil War historian” (Kirkus Reviews). From an award-winning military historian and the bestselling author of Gettysburg, this is a wide-ranging collection of essays about the Army of the Potomac, delving into such topics as Professor Lowe’s reconnaissance balloons; the court-martial of Fitz John Porter; the Lost Order at Antietam; press coverage of the war; the looting of Fredericksburg; the Mud March; the roles of volunteers, conscripts, bounty jumpers, and foreign soldiers; the notorious Gen. Dan Sickles, who shot his wife’s lover outside the White House; and two generals who were much maligned: McClellan (justifiably) and Hooker (not so justifiably). This lively book follows the Army of the Potomac throughout the war, from 1861 to 1865, painting a remarkable portrait of the key incidents and personalities that influenced the course of our nation’s greatest cataclysm.",['Stephen W. Sears'],HMH,2014-11-04,['History'],0395867606,A8DJ9EU2QP2JM,17/18,4.0,957744000,Solid Book. Well Researched and Argued,"Sears presents an interesting series of portrats relating to commanders and issues that all to freqeuntly dominated the Army of the Potomac and often stood in the way of effective prosecution of the war in the Eastern Theater.This book is well researched and effectively argued. Fans of Sear's Civil War works (of which I am one) will recognize many of the vignettes from works such as &quot;Chancellorsville,&quot; &quot;Landscape Turned Red,&quot; and &quot;The Peninsula Campaign.&quot; They are more fully fleshed out in this book, but essentially contain the same information Sears has argued before.However, this does not detract and the Sears reader will find other stories that contain new information and interesting portraits.Gen. McClellan infuses most of the tales, his presence is never far and these different affairs demonstrate how much better &quot;Little Mac&quot; was at dominating the political life of the Army than the Confederates. Sears makes a compelling argument that the hapless General was excellent at everything except fighting. It begs the question as to whether or not his talents could have been more effectively employed had he gotten Halleck's job early on and field generalship been left to Meade, Hooker or Grant (although whether or not McClellan's ego or Lincoln's needs would have been satisfied by such an arrangement is in doubt).In particular, the revolt of the generals, although covered somewhat in &quot;Chancellorsville,&quot; is a good work and telling as to why the Army of the Potomac suffered such weak leadership at crucial times. The chapters on the General Stone affair reveal the downside of political expediency during the Civil War (and the willingness of McClellan to sacrifice is friends and colleagues -- as in Stone's case and Porter's court martial -- to further his prospects.)Interestingly, the most striking analysis regards the generalship of Gen. Hooker. Although again, &quot;Chancellorsville&quot; covers this ground, Sear's original research and painstaking reconstruction of the events relating to Hooker's failure during that battle are convincing in their defense against what appears in hindsight to be the scapgoating of one of the few Union generals in the East who would and could fight. Sear's analysis is at odds with that of many Civil War chroniclers including Ken Burns, Shelby Foote and James McPherson regarding Hooker's failure during the height of the battle. After taking in the evidence, I'd say that Sears has it right.The chapters are well organized, well documented and the writing succint. This form makes for excellent &quot;pick-up&quot; reading as it is not one story but a series of portraits. Recommended.",2014,en
Late Great Planet Earth,"The impact of The Late Great Planet Earth cannot be overstated. The New York Times called it the ""no. 1 non-fiction bestseller of the decade."" For Christians and non-Christians of the 1970s, Hal Lindsey's blockbuster served as a wake-up call on events soon to come and events already unfolding -- all leading up to the greatest event of all: the return of Jesus Christ. The years since have confirmed Lindsey's insights into what biblical prophecy says about the times we live in. Whether you're a church-going believer or someone who wouldn't darken the door of a Christian institution, the Bible has much to tell you about the imminent future of this planet. In the midst of an out-of-control generation, it reveals a grand design that's unfolding exactly according to plan. The rebirth of Israel. The threat of war in the Middle East. An increase in natural catastrophes. The revival of Satanism and witchcraft. These and other signs, foreseen by prophets from Moses to Jesus, portend the coming of an antichrist . . . of a war which will bring humanity to the brink of destruction . . . and of incredible deliverance for a desperate, dying planet.",['Hal Lindsey'],Zondervan,2016-10-11,['Religion'],0553196634,A1W67G9YJ5LCG5,13/25,4.0,1074729600,Tomorrow's headlines today,"Hal Lindsey's &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot; is the kind of book that those hostile to Christianity love to analyze and criticize by distorting Lindsey's words. By golly, the man must be a false prophet, after all, he said that Israel's rebirth as a nation in 1948 was a sure sign that we were living in the &quot;last generation&quot; before the return of Christ. Since he describes a generation as lasting &quot;about 40 years&quot; in the Bible, well, golly, they claim Lindsey was predicting the end of the world (as we know it) in the year 1988. Duh, like, gee, the world didn't end in 1988 so he must be, like, you know, wrong and stuff. Duh.Such people are wolves in sheep's clothing, and sheep that mindlessly follow the wolves. They misinterpret Lindsey's words in order to contradict him. But Lindsey doesn't claim to be infallible, and most of what he saw coming way back when this book was first published has come to pass. The United States of Europe that he said the Bible prophecized is now a reality, and this body, the European Union, from which the Antichrist will rise, even uses the image of a woman on a bull (the harlot atop the beast) that the Book of Revelation presents as a symbol of this unholy union.In short, this is an excellent book. Read it with an open mind, and accept the fact that Lindsey is human and, therefore, bound to be wrong about little details and such. But when it comes to the big picture, he invariably hits the mark.And be aware that everything the Bible says will happen will surely happen, and though belief requires faith, it doesn't really require much faith to see that what the Bible foretells is being played out right before our eyes.",2016,en

Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].,"First published in 1926, ‘The Sun Also Rises’ is Ernest Hemingway’s first novel and a classic example of his spare but influential writing style. A poignant look at the disillusionment and angst of the post-World War I generation, the novel introduces two of Hemingway's most unforgettable characters: Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. Based on Hemingway's experiences, it is the story of a group of American and English expatriates living in Paris who take an excursion to Pamplona, Spain. The novel has forever associated Hemingway with bullfights and the running of the bulls. This powerful work of modern fiction, filled with memorable characters and universal themes, is summarized in this volume, which is enhanced by thought-provoking critical extracts and focused biographical details. The novel helped to establish Hemingway as one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century.","['Ernest Hemingway', 'Digital Fire']",DIGITAL FIRE,2022-05-15,['Fiction'],B000MY6VHK,AJQ1S39GZBKUG,3/3,5.0,1093564800,The importance of being Ernest,"Not many writers are like Ernest Hemingway. His style is unique and nobody will ever write like him. He is one of my favorite novelists ever and his ""The Sun Also Rises"" one of my most beloved books ever. I know there are some problems with the narrative --and there is animal cruelty that bothers me so much, but, still, this is one of the best books I have ever read.The feeling I had when I first read ""The Sun Also Rises"" is impossible to compare to any other work. The vitality and joy of this story was what I liked most. Despite the fact that it is a sad story, I can feel life coming from every paragraph. The book deals with the Lost Generation, those youngsters who lost their dreams and hope with the First World War. Afterwards they were so displeased with life that their motto was ""Live fast, die young"".The pages of ""The Sun Also Rises"" perfectly translates this momentum: every second counts, do it now, because in the future you may not be able to do again. This is the feeling that all the characters are after. The feeling of being fulfilled. However, it is not easy to find out what fulfill each person --so that is the reason why they make so many mistakes.At some point, Bill, one of the most joyful characters of the book, says, ""Our stay on earth is not for long. Let us rejoice and believe and give thanks.' This perfectly summarizes the point Hemingway is trying to state. This is what he believed by the time he wrote the novel -- in the mid 20's. ""The Sun Also Rises"" is one of the books that best show the way the writer believed people should live. All things that Hemingway liked in his life were there, like beautiful women, boxing, fishing, bullfighting and traveling through Europe. This may not be the most appropriated lifestyle for many people, but it sure worked in Europe circa 1925.Not many writers would be able to writer a book like that. If one thinks of the matter of the fact, ""The Sun Also Rises"" is almost a book about nothing. However it never let the reader feel bored. The characters' lives can be boring --they are bored most of the time. But the reader is fully immersed in that universe that he feels like part of the group. It is not hard to believe that Jake, Lady Brett, Bill, Cohn and the others are not our friends. They are so exposed to us --that in the end we know more about them then themselves. In the end, we know so much about life that we could expect from a book. And Ernest Hemingway is one of the few who can do that.",2022,en

Dead also is Camber of Culdi, who served as the Deryni’s most faithful friend in the royal court. With young King Alroy too immature and weak to rule effectively, no one holds the power to halt the reign of genocidal terror that sweeps across the land—not even Prince Javan Haldane, Alroy’s twin, who recognizes the perfidy of the regents and religious zealots hovering around his royal brother. But there is an equally distressing concern for the surviving children of Camber, whose body remains uncorrupted weeks after his death, suggesting that his soul may be trapped somewhere between earth and heaven—and nothing short of the ultimate sacrifice can set Camber free. Award-winning fantasist Katherine Kurtz continues her chronicles of an extraordinary medieval race in a magnificent series that picks up where her acclaimed Camber of Culdi trilogy left off.

Sea Assault: The Sinking of Japan's Secret Supership,"New York Times Bestseller The final volume of the magisterial Pacific War Trilogy from acclaimed historian Ian W. Toll, “one of the great storytellers of War” (Evan Thomas). In June 1944, the United States launched a crushing assault on the Japanese navy in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. The capture of the Mariana Islands and the accompanying ruin of Japanese carrier airpower marked a pivotal moment in the Pacific War. No tactical masterstroke or blunder could reverse the increasingly lopsided balance of power between the two combatants. The War in the Pacific had entered its endgame. Beginning with the Honolulu Conference, when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt met with his Pacific theater commanders to plan the last phase of the campaign against Japan, Twilight of the Gods brings to life the harrowing last year of World War II in the Pacific, when the U.S. Navy won the largest naval battle in history; Douglas MacArthur made good his pledge to return to the Philippines; waves of kamikazes attacked the Allied fleets; the Japanese fought to the last man on one island after another; B-29 bombers burned down Japanese cities; and Hiroshima and Nagasaki were vaporized in atomic blasts. Ian W. Toll’s narratives of combat in the air, at sea, and on the beaches are as gripping as ever, but he also reconstructs the Japanese and American home fronts and takes the reader into the halls of power in Washington and Tokyo, where the great questions of strategy and diplomacy were decided. Drawing from a wealth of rich archival sources and new material, Twilight of the Gods casts a penetrating light on the battles, grand strategic decisions and naval logistics that enabled the Allied victory in the Pacific. An authoritative and riveting account of the final phase of the War in the Pacific, Twilight of the Gods brings Toll’s masterful trilogy to a thrilling conclusion. This prize-winning and best-selling trilogy will stand as the first complete history of the Pacific War in more than twenty-five years, and the first multivolume history of the Pacific naval war since Samuel Eliot Morison’s series was published in the 1950s.",['Ian W.

In this World War II tale we follow the American sub Archer-Fischer and her tentative skipper, Captain Joseph F. Enright, on her hunt and discovery of Japan's new secret weapon, a 72,000-ton aircraft carrier. What ensues is likened to a high stakes chess game scattered across the throes of the south Pacific.The book alternates point of view every other chapter. One chapter is written in the first person by its author, Captain Enright. The other point of view is told using Japanese sources and follows the carrier's skipper, Japanese Captain Abe.As the Archer-Fish tracks, then closes in and subsequently engages the huge carrier, the Shinano, you vicariously experience this all from the vantage point of your chair.For example:&quot;All of us could now hear the sharp sounds of the destroyer's propellers as she headed our way. When dropped to a keel depth of 62-feet, we would have about 10 feet between Archer-Fish's upper periscope support and the destroyer's keel. The Japanese war ship churned closer. The noise of its propellers increased in volume as she whipped through the water ... The destroyer rolling the water right above us. The beat of the big propellers so close was breathtaking. She thundered overhead like a locomotive. The whole submarine vibrated and rolled from the shock waves...""Not only was the sinking of the carrier, the Shining, an epic event, but its telling her makes it an epic read.

In 1929, in the blue-collar city of Portsmouth, Ohio, a company built a swimming pool the size of a football field; named Dreamland, it became the vital center of the community. Now, addiction has devastated Portsmouth, as it has hundreds of small rural towns and suburbs across America--addiction like no other the country has ever faced. How that happened is the riveting story of Dreamland. With a great reporter's narrative skill and the storytelling ability of a novelist, acclaimed journalist Sam Quinones weaves together two classic tales of capitalism run amok whose unintentional collision has been catastrophic. The unfettered prescribing of pain medications during the 1990s reached its peak in Purdue Pharma's campaign to market OxyContin, its new, expensive--extremely addictive--miracle painkiller. Meanwhile, a massive influx of black tar heroin--cheap, potent, and originating from one small county on Mexico's west coast, independent of any drug cartel--assaulted small town and mid-sized cities across the country, driven by a brilliant, almost unbeatable marketing and distribution system. Together these phenomena continue to lay waste to communities from Tennessee to Oregon, Indiana to New Mexico. Introducing a memorable cast of characters--pharma pioneers, young Mexican entrepreneurs, narcotics investigators, survivors, and parents--Quinones shows how these tales fit together. Dreamland is a revelatory account of the corrosive threat facing America and its heartland.",['Sam Quinones'],Bloomsbury Press,2016-04-05,['Social Science'],0694521086,A3TIVVQ0M11XFZ,0/0,4.0,1361318400,Life in Old New York,"In this novel, Kevin Baker transports the reader to the New York of 1910. Baker weaves several plot lines together to create a complex tapestry depicting life in that era.Tammany Hall controls the city. Even the mayor is a puppet for corrupt politicians. Factory workers put in long hours in squalid sweatshops for low pay. Gangsters and criminals roam the city looking for easy prey. Homeless children sleep in alleyways. Prostitutes, con men and corrupt policemen are everywhere. As one character in the novel says, ""Everyone has a racket in this town.""Baker contrasts the struggle of life in the city with the fantasy world of the Coney Island amusement parks. He describes how each summer the people of the city come to shrug off their cares and embrace the hedonistic pleasures of the parks.To tell his story, Baker uses a large cast of interesting characters. Each character has a unique point of view.Some of Bakers memorable characters are:Essie who escapes the drudgery of work in a sweat shop by having an affair with a gangster hiding out in Dreamland.Kid Twist who came to America by walking across Europe and stowing away in ship bound for New York.Big Tim Sullivan who is a corrupt Tammany politician. He controls saloons, gangsters, and the Mayor of New York.The Great Head Doctors from Vienna who are Sigmund Freud and his protege Carl Jung. They give a European perspective to the chaos of New York.Trick the Dwarf is the narrator of the story. Trick sometimes enters regular society by passing as a young boy. He experiences the best and worst times of the Dreamland amusement park.For me, this novel was a long slow struggle to finish. I kept reading because I wanted to find out how Baker resolved the plot lines. Spoiler Alert - He doesn't. He brings the story to an end, but there is no great climax. And perhaps that is the point. In real life not all of our plot lines are resolved. We may escape reality for a while, but life goes on.This novel is a very well written historical novel.

Moby-Dick or the Whale,"Call me Ishmael. So begins the famous opening chapter of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale. Young sailor Ishmael is hired as a crew member of a whaler named Pequod, captained by a man named Ahab. In between lengthy chapters on whale biology and descriptions of the crew and the whaling trade, readers are slowly introduced to a captivating tale. Ahab is out for revenge on the great white whale that stole his leg, leaving him with a whale-bone prosthesis and a withering hatred for the beast. Known as Moby Dick, the whale is infamous for his encounters and escapes with whale ships, and Ahab offers a gold coin, nailed to the Pequod's mast, as a reward for whoever sights him first. Beginning on a cold Christmas morning, the crew embarks on a journey to find the whale and make their fortunes. An exciting staple of American literature, Moby-Dick is a must-read for anyone interested in the classics. Herman Melville was inspired to write Moby Dick by the 1821 biographical account Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-ship Essex (Cosimo Classics, 2015), which in turn inspired the 2000 novel and 2015 movie, In the Heart of the Sea. HERMAN MELVILLE (1819-1891) was an American novelist. Born in New York, Melville lived and worked in the city for many years before moving with his family to Massachusetts, where he enjoyed a short friendship with author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Many of Melville's books are inspired by his own experiences; he sailed on merchant and whaling ships, spent time on the Marquesas Islands with natives, and spent time in England, Egypt, and Palestine. Melville even wrote poetry reflecting on the American Civil War. He eventually retired in New York City, where he was buried in the Bronx, relatively unknown. Melville was the author of 19 books of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, including *Typee* (1846), Moby-Dick (1851), ""Bartelby the Scrivener"" (1853), ""Benito Cerino"" (1855), Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War (1866), and Billy Budd, Sailor (1891, unfinished).",['H.

Moby Dick was the first book on my list. It took me three months to finish this legendary story and, looking back on it now, I must say that it was worth every minute. To others who are considering this effort I say this: buttress your stamina and open your mind. This is not John Grisham or Tom Clancy. You will be reading high literature and you will be required to think. If you do so, Ishmael, Ahab and crew will open a window to some of mankind's most profound questions: Is it better to fight evil or promote virtue? Where is the line between honorable justice and blind vengeance? Do bad things happen because the universe is evil or just indifferent? The true pleasure to be derived from reading this book can be found by closing its pages every so often and reflecting on the questions that it will raise in your mind. A completely different experience than breezing through the latest best-seller, but much more rewarding.Be aware that Moby Dick is many types of books in one.

The Exorcist,"Originally published in 1971, The Exorcist, one of the most controversial novels ever written, went on to become a literary phenomenon: It spent fifty-seven weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, seventeen consecutively at number one. Inspired by a true story of a child’s demonic possession in the 1940s, William Peter Blatty created an iconic novel that focuses on Regan, the eleven-year-old daughter of a movie actress residing in Washington, D.C. A small group of overwhelmed yet determined individuals must rescue Regan from her unspeakable fate, and the drama that ensues is gripping and unfailingly terrifying. Two years after its publication, The Exorcist was, of course, turned into a wildly popular motion picture, garnering ten Academy Award nominations. On opening day of the film, lines of the novel’s fans stretched around city blocks. In Chicago, frustrated moviegoers used a battering ram to gain entry through the double side doors of a theater. In Kansas City, police used tear gas to disperse an impatient crowd who tried to force their way into a cinema. The three major television networks carried footage of these events; CBS’s Walter Cronkite devoted almost ten minutes to the story. The Exorcist was, and is, more than just a novel and a film: it is a true landmark. Purposefully raw and profane, The Exorcist still has the extraordinary ability to disturb readers and cause them to forget that it is “just a story.” Published here in this beautiful fortieth anniversary edition, it remains an unforgettable reading experience and will continue to shock and frighten a new generation of readers.",['William Peter Blatty'],Harper,2011-10-04,['Fiction'],B000P18Z2O,A2O9HU1K7TCF7B,3/3,5.0,1161302400,A Watershed Book in the Genre of Horror,"Few villians have the same ability to scare as the devil himself.

As is the case in many books that are translated into movies, many of the themes of the book are lost on the silver screen. The ambigious sexuality of one of the priests is omitted from the movie. Many of the traits of the possessed child also become the victim of the editor. The Dennings murder also is more of a focus in the book. With this omission, we never get to know the caretakers of the house and their conflicts which really add a new dimension to the whole plot.The book gives a more intimate insight into many of the characters. For this reason alone, I would recommed fans of the movie read the book. While he may not be a well known writer, Blatty has other works that are worth noting. His catalog has made me a fan.",2011,en

A smart, funny, gorgeous retelling starring all characters of color. Zuri Benitez has pride. Brooklyn pride, family pride, and pride in her Afro-Latino roots. But pride might not be enough to save her rapidly gentrifying neighborhood from becoming unrecognizable. When the wealthy Darcy family moves in across the street, Zuri wants nothing to do with their two teenage sons, even as her older sister, Janae, starts to fall for the charming Ainsley. She especially can’t stand the judgmental and arrogant Darius. Yet as Zuri and Darius are forced to find common ground, their initial dislike shifts into an unexpected understanding. But with four wild sisters pulling her in different directions, cute boy Warren vying for her attention, and college applications hovering on the horizon, Zuri fights to find her place in Bushwick’s changing landscape, or lose it all.

"The Birth of the Republic, 1763-89","In The Birth of the Republic, 1763–89, Edmund S. Morgan shows how the challenge of British taxation started Americans on a search for constitutional principles to protect their freedom, and eventually led to the Revolution. By demonstrating that the founding fathers’ political philosophy was not grounded in theory, but rather grew out of their own immediate needs, Morgan paints a vivid portrait of how the founders’ own experiences shaped their passionate convictions, and these in turn were incorporated into the Constitution and other governmental documents. The Birth of the Republic is the classic account of the beginnings of the American government, and in this fourth edition the original text is supplemented with a new foreword by Joseph J. Ellis and a historiographic essay by Rosemarie Zagarri.",['Edmund S. Morgan'],University of Chicago Press,2012-12-15,['History'],B000KN1LQ4,A4NG0X67UZ8WW,0/0,5.0,1359072000,Doesn't compromise depth in it's achievement of brevity,"Edmund S. Morgan has written a highly readable introduction to the American Revolution for anyone looking to re-educate themselves on the founding of the United States or delve in for the first time (if you happened to of slept through high school history). This is a book which would be excellent in a university survey course and I am saddened that it was not required reading for myself while in college. I undoubtedly plan on using excerpts from it when teaching in my own high school history course and looking to bring in outside sources.The book itself highlights all of the main events which constituted the Revolution and early republic. It covers the various Acts imposed by Parliament which led up to the Declaration of Independence, several key battles, the main cast of characters and Founding Fathers, the challenges faced by the young republic, and concludes with the 'critical period' and ratification of the constitution. Those anticipating detailed accounts of how particular battles were won or lost though will be disappointed, as this is not the focus of the book.I believe that this piece works so well because of Professor Morgan's success at covering the main events, pointing out areas of academic/moral debate, and then arguing his own point of view in an even-handed and defensible way. He points out the hypocrisy of numerous founders owning slaves, but also emphasizes the need the founders had of ratifying the constitution in order to preserve the young Union and the fact that they would have been unable to do this had the north pushed strongly for emancipation. This haste in working towards ratification led to 'compromises' which invariably hurt women and slaves, and greatly delayed freedom and suffrage. Also, he makes a nod towards those historians who diminish the Founding Fathers as men only concerned with their economic well-being, but argues that they were also indeed men of principle.I found this a very enjoyable book and even if you are in disagreement with some of his opinions, it is hard to deny its accomplishment in brevity (without lacking in depth) and well-written style. I greatly enjoyed it and recommend it highly to any seeking a refresher in basic US history.",2012,en

How Green Was My Valley,"The international bestselling winner of the National Book Award and the basis for the Academy Award Best Picture film directed by John Ford. Huw Morgan remembers the days when his home valley was prosperous, verdant, and beautiful—before the mines came to town.

Full of memorable characters, richly crafted language, and surprising humor, How Green Was My Valley is the first of four books chronicling Huw’s life, including the sequels Up into the Singing Mountain, Down Where the Moon is Small, and Green, Green My Valley Now. “The reader emerges from these tense pages strangely aglow with sharing the happiness of the characters . . .

Recent research has demonstrated a direct link between oral health and chronic illness. Simply improving the health of your teeth and gums can cure many chronic problems. More brushing, flossing, and mouthwash isn’t the solution. What will work is Oil Pulling Therapy. Oil pulling is an age-old method of oral cleansing originating from Ayurvedic medicine. It is one of the most powerful, most effective methods of detoxification and healing in natural medicine. In this book, Dr. Fife combines the wisdom of Ayurvedic medicine with modern science. The science behind oil pulling is fully documented with references to medical studies and case histories.

Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library),"In a timely update of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, National Book Award finalist Ibi Zoboi skillfully balances cultural identity, class, and gentrification against the heady magic of first love in her vibrant reimagining of this beloved classic. A smart, funny, gorgeous retelling starring all characters of color. Zuri Benitez has pride. Brooklyn pride, family pride, and pride in her Afro-Latino roots. But pride might not be enough to save her rapidly gentrifying neighborhood from becoming unrecognizable. When the wealthy Darcy family moves in across the street, Zuri wants nothing to do with their two teenage sons, even as her older sister, Janae, starts to fall for the charming Ainsley. She especially can’t stand the judgmental and arrogant Darius. Yet as Zuri and Darius are forced to find common ground, their initial dislike shifts into an unexpected understanding. But with four wild sisters pulling her in different directions, cute boy Warren vying for her attention, and college applications hovering on the horizon, Zuri fights to find her place in Bushwick’s changing landscape, or lose it all.

Organic Chemistry,"Organic Chemistry: Structure, Mechanism, Synthesis, Second Edition, provides basic principles of this fascinating and challenging science, which lies at the interface of physical and biological sciences. Offering accessible language and engaging examples and illustrations, this valuable introduction for the in-depth chemistry course engages students and gives future and new scientists a new approach to understanding, rather than merely memorizing the key concepts underpinning this fundamental area. The book builds in a logical way from chemical bonding to resulting molecular structures, to the corresponding physical, chemical and biological properties of those molecules. The book explores how molecular structure determines reaction mechanisms, from the smallest to the largest molecules—which in turn determine strategies for organic synthesis. The book then describes the synthetic principles which extend to every aspect of synthesis, from drug design to the methods cells employ to synthesize the molecules of which they are made. These relationships form a continuous narrative throughout the book, in which principles logically evolve from one to the next, from the simplest to the most complex examples, with abundant connections between the theory and applications. Featuring in-book solutions and instructor PowerPoint slides, this Second Edition offers an updated and improved option for students in the two-semester course and for scientists who require a high quality introduction or refresher in the subject. Offers improvements for the two-semester course sequence and valuable updates including two new chapters on lipids and nucleic acids Features biochemistry and biological examples highlighted throughout the book, making the information relevant and engaging to readers of all backgrounds and interests Includes a valuable and highly-praised chapter on organometallic chemistry not found in other standard references","['J.

No doubt, these errors were taught to a significant number of students, and have resulted in some ribbing of the authors by their peers. Nonetheless, the third edition still contains significant errors. Bright students will find those errors confusing, as they contradict what they learn about pKa's and acid/base chemistry within the text.Text information states pKa values are for the conjugate acids of bases listed in tables, and this further confuses students, who assume the molecules listed are the acids themselves.Incredible leaps of logic must be required for students to take sparse detail in the text and apply them to complex problems in the problem sets. Although the problems are enjoyable for Ph.D.'s in the field, they miss the mark regarding beginning students. I find the problems relevant and amusing, but they are often advanced or graduate level. In contrast,example problems in the text are quite simplistic.It appears that the text attempts to address biochemistry, polymer and medicinal chemistry to some level - but must sacrifice content in the core areas of organic chemistry in order to satisfy the unwritten rule of a book of dimensions of 1.5&quot; x 8&quot; x 10&quot; for the publisher.The sidebars were a reasonable attempt to humanize chemistry. University academics are still scratching their heads as to why they continue to have trouble interesting students in chemistry - they need to look close to home regarding text and laboratory material. Both seem to provide an exercise in futility for U.S. students. Scientific method is taught in high school, and promptly forgotten. Logic and flow is missing today.Good luck with the next edition!",2018,en
Kingdoms of the Wall,"A pilgrimage leads to a shocking revelation in this “deeply affecting and evocative extraterrestrial novel” from the Hugo and Nebula Award–winning author (Locus). The village of Jespodar nestles in the foothills of a world-dominating mountain known to all as ""The Wall."" Poilar Crookleg has grown up in Jespodar training hard and hoping that he will be chosen for the annual Pilgrimage, a group journey to the top of the mountain from which no pilgrim has ever returned both alive and sane. The pilgrims seek to replicate the legendary journey of a distant ancestor who scaled the mountain and, so the story goes, met with the gods. The Pilgrimage is a a life journey, an overwhelming challenge and a sacred honor and Poilar feels blessed when he is finally chosen to lead it. But not all is as it first seems. Along the journey lie hazards of all kinds, both vilently dangerous and seductively beguiling and to triumph in the climb is to confront a revelation so surprising and so disturbing that none, not even the smartest and best prepared, are likely to survive. What belief and what devotion leads so many to hope for such a challenging task and what will be the ultimate result of such dedication? Only The Wall itself can reveal the destiny for those who undertake the Pilgrimage.",['Robert Silverberg'],Open Road Media,2014-04-01,['Fiction'],B000K2SU5A,A3BR4RIE8HDY1W,9/9,5.0,1060905600,A great work by a great author.,"Like an ancient palimpsest, this is a book with layers of meaning. Picture a planet whose physical features are dominated by a single tremendously massive mountain peak with attendant foot-hills. At the foot of the mountain are clustered numerous villages, each with defined strata of clans and guild-like rankings. The people of the villages revere an ancient ancestor who is believed to have scaled the mountain and at its peak met with and received gifts from the Gods that enabled him to kick-start ""human"" civilization. Every year in commemoration, each village sends a team of chosen Pilgrims to replicate his climb. Few have returned from this pilgrimage and none of those few returnees has retained his or her sanity.To be selected as one of the Pilgrims is a sought-after honor that most of the village children aspire to. The story follows one team of Pilgrims through the words of Poilar Crookleg, its leader. Silverberg takes us through the culling of the Pilgrims from the pool of applicants (a process that first causes Poilar to begin questioning some of his beliefs) and on to the actual climb. On its trek, the team of Pilgrims must surmount numerous hazards ranging from the violent to the beguiling. Many are the temptations to turn aside and leave the Pilgrimage; the growing hardships, the lure of sirens, the seductive hypnosis of the Kavnalla, the bliss of eternal youth. These are well described indeed, in their allure and their horror, and I initially thought Silverberg was spinning an allegorical rite of passage.The culmination of the Pilgrimage however shatters the Pilgrims (through the reader sees it coming well beforehand). I do not wish to spoil the pleasure of readers so I will only say that Silverberg makes us feel the loss of moorings and direction experienced by the Pilgrims when they learn that their entire life has been given to a fable.

At first, I thought it was a little odd that the sections of the book were so far apart in time, but as I kept reading, it began to make sense. Asimov wasn't trying to tell a story about specific characters as we're used to thinking of them (i.e., individual people), rather, he was aiming to tell the story of a civilization. As I read, it began to make perfect sense. His premise is that the actions of humans as a race can be predicted on a large scale. In order to get that across, the story had to be told using large scale and long time periods. Whether Asmiov was thinking of this or not, I can't say. But it works.",2012,en
"We Were Soldiers Once...and Young: Ia Drang, The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam","New York Times Bestseller: A “powerful and epic story . . . the best account of infantry combat I have ever read” (Col. David Hackworth, author of About Face). In November 1965, some 450 men of the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. Harold Moore, were dropped into a small clearing in the Ia Drang Valley. They were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Three days later, only two and a half miles away, a sister battalion was brutally slaughtered. Together, these actions at the landing zones X-Ray and Albany constituted one of the most savage and significant battles of the Vietnam War. They were the first major engagements between the US Army and the People’s Army of Vietnam. How these Americans persevered—sacrificing themselves for their comrades and never giving up—creates a vivid portrait of war at its most devastating and inspiring. Lt. Gen. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway—the only journalist on the ground throughout the fighting—interviewed hundreds of men who fought in the battle, including the North Vietnamese commanders. Their poignant account rises above the ordeal it chronicles to depict men facing the ultimate challenge, dealing with it in ways they would have once found unimaginable.

An Intimate History of Humanity,'The book that changed my life... a constant companion' Bill Bailey 'Extraordinary and beautiful...the most exciting and ambitious work of non-fiction I have read in more than a decade' The Daily Telegraph This extraordinarily wide-ranging study looks at the dilemmas of life today and shows how they need not have arisen. Portraits of living people and historical figures are placed alongside each other as Zeldin discusses how men and women have lost and regained hope; how they have learnt to have interesting conversations; how some have acquired an immunity to loneliness; how new forms of love and desire have been invented; how respect has become more valued than power; how the art of escaping from one's troubles has developed; why even the privileged are often gloomy; and why parents and children are changing their minds about what they want from each other.,['Theodore Zeldin'],Random House,2012-12-31,['Philosophy'],B000HF53G4,A2UGG169K8C6SN,49/59,2.0,1047340800,Whose humanity?,"Theodore Zeldin announces his project in a brief preface. It bristles with the energy of ambition. We sense that we may be about to launch into something truly revolutionary:""I want to show how, today, it is possible for individuals to form a fresh view both of their own personal history and of humanity's whole record of cruelty, misunderstanding, and joy. To have a new vision of the future, it has always first been necessary to have a new vision of the past.... Instead of explaining the peculiarity of individuals by pointing to their family or childhood, I take a longer view: I show how they pay attention to--or ignore--the experience of previous, more distant generations, and how they are continuing the struggles of many other communities all over the world ... among whom they have more soul-mates than they may realize.""The 25 chapters that follow bear titles like ""How humans have repeatedly lost hope, and how new encounters, and a new pair of spectacles, revive them,"" and ""How people choose a way of life, and how it does not wholly satisfy them."" Each chapter begins with a portrait of one or several people in the contemporary world--usually French women--focusing on a particular life problem, or a creative attempt at solving such a problem. Zeldin follows this portrait with a brief history of that problem, or of a clearly related phenomenon.For instance, the first chapter opens with a portrait of Juliette, a domestic servant who feels trapped in her job, in her social class, and by the unbridgeable distance between her and potential friends. This portrait is followed by a history of slavery--not a linear history, but a selective highlighting of relevant themes and moments in the history of slavery. Zeldin emphasizes that not all slaves have been so involuntarily, nor is there such a great difference between those who are enslaved forcibly and those who are enslaved by their own lack of imagination. The overall effect is that we gain a stronger sense of kinship with medieval Slavs and others whose history is contrasted with Juliette's, as well as a stronger sense of our own agency in determining how we might fit ourselves into the patterns of history.This first chapter is one of the strongest in the book, and I summarize it as an example of Zeldin's project at its brightest. Throughout the book, Zeldin writes with admirable compassion, as well as with an unapologetic earnestness that would read as idealistically nave if it weren't for the intelligence and determined sincerity of his prose. These qualities made me want his project to succeed, and yet by the hundredth page I had already almost given up on it.I had hoped to find a deep history of psychology and morality, a revelation that our preoccupations, passions, and needs, and the consequent values that they engender, have a long genealogy that is far from transparent. Such a history might help to disabuse us of the feelings of necessity and immutability that hover about our frustrations. However, rather than present us with a rich diversity of psychological and ethical concerns, Zeldin is keen to impose modern values and preoccupations on that past, dictating the morals we are to learn from his histories rather than allowing us to draw our own lessons and conclusions.I believe the lack of relativism is quite intentional. Zeldin is inspired by the universalism of the Enlightenment, and speaks admiringly of the Declaration of the Rights of Man as being a declaration not just for the French people, but for all people. He wants us to see that all humans share a great deal, that people of different eras and cultures are not so different from us. Applying liberal values and contemporary emotional preoccupations to times past may foster a greater sense of kinship, but I think it is also deeply misleading. If our aim is to understand people of other cultures, we must make a determined effort to understand them as they understand themselves. How useful is a feeling of kinship if it is based ultimately on misrepresentation?A further unfortunate consequence of Zeldin's imposition of liberal values on the past is that, despite an impressive range of examples, the book becomes repetitive. An exhortation toward open-mindedness can be given quite thoroughly in twenty pages. If a book of 472 pages returns again and again to a very basic set of themes, without elaborating on them or moving beyond them, it becomes tiresome no matter how many engaging historical anecdotes it contains. Despite the staggering breadth of Zeldin's reading, despite the range and diversity of the lives he portrays, this book ultimately makes for a disappointingly narrow read.And while it is hard to fault the impressive range of material that Zeldin leads us through quite comfortably, certain choices narrow the breadth of the book even further. His justification for interviewing French women almost exclusively (he doesn't seem to register that almost all these women are also white) reads as a half-hearted apology for Francophilia. While we do get the occasional glimpse into the rich cultures of India, China, and Japan (less so with cultures with less sophisticated literary traditions) most of his anecdotes draw from the history of the Christian and Muslim West. While it would be unreasonable to demand a deep knowledge of all aspects of world history (though a project this ambitious would seem to require it) there are moments that the need for a non-Western point of contrast or comparison is sorely felt.Zeldin wishes to speak for all humanity, but he succeeds only in speaking of all humanity, and even there his effort is lackluster. In truth, he only speaks for those of us in the modern West, and in addressing our current preoccupations with a therapeutic aim, his book reads as much like self-help as it does like a history.",2012,en

Dick is not only one of the ""one of the most valiant psychological explorers of the 20th century"" (The New York Times) but a source of divine revelation. In the riveting style that won accolades for The Adversary, Emmanuel Carrère's I Am Alive and You Are Dead, follows Dick's strange odyssey from his traumatic beginnings in 1928, when his twin sister died in infancy, to his lonely end in 1982, beset by mystical visions of swirling pink light, three-eyed invaders, and messages from the Roman Empire. Drawing on interviews as well as unpublished sources, he vividly conjures the spirit of this restless observer of American postwar malaise who subverted the materials of science fiction--parallel universes, intricate time loops, collective delusions--to create classic works of contemporary anxiety.",['Emmanuel Carrère'],Metropolitan Books,2017-10-24,['Biography & Autobiography'],0747569193,A1WD8SD9L65UN3,0/0,5.0,1283472000,PKD Devotees Will Love This,"If you've read 10 or 20 Dick novels and been enthralled by Dick's delightfully twisted take on things; if you've read one of Lawrence Sutin's, Paul Williams' or Gregg Rickman's bios of the man; if you think you know all you need to about PKD-- well, you need to read this book.

A Very Long Engagement,"During the First World War five French soldiers, accused of a cowardly attempt to evade duty, are bundled into no-man's land and certain death. Five bodies are later recovered, the families are notified that the men died in the line of duty and the whole, distasteful incident appears closed. After the war the fianc-e of one of the men receives a letter which hints at what might have happened. Mathilde Donnay determines to discover the fate of her beloved amid the carnage of battle. A Very Long Engagement turns into an unusual and engrossing thriller as she discovers an increasing number of people trying to put her off the scent. Japrisot's achievement is to have written a novel that is both a suspenseful thriller and one which transforms a single small incident into the epitome of all wartime atrocities.

The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Penguin Classics),"This book explores Bernard Shaw’s journalism from the mid-1880s through the Great War—a period in which Shaw contributed some of the most powerful and socially relevant journalism the western world has experienced. In approaching Shaw’s journalism, the promoter and abuser of the New Journalism, W. T. Stead, is contrasted to Shaw, as Shaw countered the sensational news copy Stead and his disciples generated. To understand Shaw’s brand of New Journalism, his responses to the popular press’ portrayals of high profile historical crises are examined, while other examples prompting Shaw’s journalism over the period are cited for depth: the 1888 Whitechapel murders, the 1890-91 O’Shea divorce scandal that fell Charles Stewart Parnell, peace crusades within militarism, the catastrophic Titanic sinking, and the Great War. Through Shaw’s journalism that undermined the popular press’ shock efforts that prevented rational thought, Shaw endeavored to promote clear thinking through the immediacy of his critical journalism. Arguably, Shaw saved the free press.","[""Nelson O'Ceallaigh Ritschel""]",Springer,2017-02-07,['Performing Arts'],0613642910,A3NL83J9TWP6OM,1/1,5.0,1305417600,Like an Aged and Fine Wine,Still very vibrant and still amazingly witty for today.

Old Man & the Sea,"From the New York Times–bestselling author of Poison Flower: a retired intelligence officer is caught in “[a] harrowing hunt-and-hide adventure” (The New York Times). To all appearances, Dan Chase is a harmless retiree in Vermont with two big mutts and a grown daughter he keeps in touch with by phone. But most sixty-year-old widowers don’t have multiple driver’s licenses, savings stockpiled in banks across the country, or two Beretta Nanos stashed in the spare bedroom closet. Most have not spent decades on the run. Thirty-five years ago, as a young army intelligence hotshot, Chase was sent to Libya to covertly assist a rebel army. When the plan turned sour, Chase acted according to his conscience—and triggered consequences he never could have anticipated. To this day, someone still wants him dead. And just when he thought he was finally safe, Chase is confronted with the history he spent much of his life trying to escape. “Perry drives deep into Jack Reacher territory in this stand-alone [novel] . . .

For example, ""Eat them good now and then there is the tuna."" Hemmingway lacks the words to catch the reader's attention. This causes the reader to get tired of the story and drift into other thoughts. For instance, ""But I will kill you dead before this day ends."" That sentence is filled with clutter. Hemmingway made that sentence complicated. Simplifying the sentence would make it easier to understand. If Hemmingway used less clutter in the book the number of pages would be cut in half.The Old Man and The Sea is a highly predictable book. The Old Man and The Sea lets the reader always see what is going to happen next in the book. In addition, ""The shark was not an accident."" Throughout the entire story the readers have a sense that what is happening to Santiago is too good to be true. Don't watch the biography of Ernest Hemmingway before reading The Old Man and The Sea.

The Message of the Sermon on the Mount (Bible Speaks Today),"The Sermon on the Mount contains Jesus' description of what he wanted his followers to be and do. In this BST volume, John Stott guides readers through Matthew 5 through 7, identifying key themes, confronting the challenges this text raises for today's Christians, and drawing out practical applications.",['John Stott'],InterVarsity Press,2020-05-19,['Religion'],0877842965,AYOPOFV2QKC31,7/7,5.0,1176768000,Theological Orthodoxy Coupled with Good Sense and a Broad Scope,"John R. W. Stott, The Message of the Sermon on the Mount. Christian Counter-Culture. Leicester/England and Downers Grove, Illinois: InterVarsity Press. First edition 1978; regularly reprinted in this format since 1984. 238 pages.Although this book is, in the meantime, almost 30 years old, it remains as timeless as the Bible chapters on which it is commenting - and as a reminder of what a tremendous gift John Stott has been to the church in his role as teacher and author. His ""Message of the Sermon on the Mount"" has a number of characteristics which make it more or less ideal as a guide through three of the New Testament's most fascinating, but also most difficult chapters. The first of these characteristics is its intellectual plausibility and good sense: Stott nowhere speculates, never goes off at a tangent, but always gives a thorough, intelligent, well thought-out explanation of the text that takes account of opposing views but counters these with irrefutable arguments. The second characteristic is its theological orthodoxy, coupled however with broadness of scope, awareness of other positions and honesty in the face of difficulties. Stott is never dogmatically narrow-minded, but always loyal not only to the ipsa verba, but to the very spirit of the Biblical text - something that should warm every Christian's heart. A third characteristic is Stott's familiarity with the literature and his adeptness in providing apt quotes at just the right moment. And he does not limit himself here to other commentaries or to parallel Bible verses; there is a liberal sprinkling of pithy comment from Augustine and Chrysostom from the early church period, from the great reformers Luther and Calvin, and from more modern theologians and thinkers of various schools, e. g. Joachim Jeremias, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, A. B. Bruce, Alfred Plummer, even C. S. Lewis. And of course, Stott has read and digested Dr. D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones's massive volume of sermons on Matthew 5 thru 7Studies in the Sermon on the Mount. A fourth characteristic would be Stott's balance between the more ""evangelistic"" type of approach and the social aspects of the Christian faith. And a fifth characteristic would be his insistence on the supremacy and sovereignty of Jesus Christ as the Son of God and only Saviour.If you are looking for a book of ""manageable"" size on the Sermon on the Mount, and assuming you require a volume which is really faithful to the words of the text, you could do no better than turn to Stott's classic exposition. This is one of the absolute highlights of the ""The Bible Speaks Today"" series (which, in itself, has proved, in my opinion, rather uneven).",2020,en
Minor Apocalypse,"In A Minor Apocalypse, Robert Blobaum explores the social and cultural history of Warsaw's ""forgotten war"" of 1914–1918. Beginning with the bank panic that accompanied the outbreak of the Great War, Blobaum guides his readers through spy scares, bombardments, mass migratory movements, and the Russian evacuation of 1915. Industrial collapse marked only the opening phase of Warsaw’s wartime economic crisis, which grew steadily worse during the German occupation. Requisitioning and strict control of supplies entering the city resulted in scarcity amid growing corruption, rapidly declining living standards, and major public health emergencies. Blobaum shows how conflicts over distribution of and access to resources led to social divisions, a sharp deterioration in Polish-Jewish relations, and general distrust in public institutions. Women’s public visibility, demands for political representation, and perceived threats to the patriarchal order during the war years sustained one arena of cultural debate. New modes of popular entertainment, including cinema, cabaret, and variety shows, created another, particularly as they challenged elite notions of propriety. Blobaum presents these themes in comparative context, not only with other major European cities during the Great War but also with Warsaw under Nazi German occupation a generation later.",['Robert E.

Talk Before Sleep,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “Unforgettable . . . Truth rings forth clearly from every page. . . . One minute you’re laughing, the next you’re crying. . . . You’ll want to give a copy to every good woman friend you have.”—The Charlotte Observer What do you say when you know you don’t have forever? Ruth has been Ann’s closest friend for years—her confidante, her solace, her comic relief, her tutor in life’s mysterious ways. So when Ruth becomes ill, Ann is there for her without question. After all, it is Ruth who encouraged Ann to become who she is, Ruth whose rebellious, eccentric spirit provided the perfect counterpoint to Ann’s conventional, safe outlook. And so the friends go on as they always have . . . gossiping, consoling, and sharing intimate secrets—but with the knowledge that each shared evening could be their last. Acclaimed author Elizabeth Berg has created a searing novel about the strength and salvation of women’s friendships. Deeply moving and surprisingly funny, Talk Before Sleep is an intimate, uncensored portrait of love and loss, struggle and resilience. “Tender and irreverent by turns, [Talk Before Sleep] offers mature, intelligent and buoyant spirit, like a very good friend.”—Houston Post “Entertaining, finely crafted . . .

Berg does a wonderful job drawing the readers into the private lives of the characters ~~ and you don't feel that you are standing on the outside either. You're drawn to Annie because of her nurturing, caretaker nature, and you're drawn to Ruth like a moth to a flame ~~ full of life and laughter.If you haven't read this book yet, I would suggest you do so soon.

For example, whether you agree or not about her wrath at the Metropolitan Museum's encroachment on Central Park, the fact of that remains.The other is related to the first but independent. This book captures Manhattan at a moment - as it happened the bicentennial year which was also the year the city's finances collapsed. Since then, the World Trade Center has been forced to become an American symbol. It is curious to note how little it was admired, by Miss Hanff, when it was new. (I was there only once but tend to share her opinion.)There are other examples of how fast things change. In fact, this book was updated in 1988, and Hanff mentioned - as a point in Manhattan's favor despite her disgust about the Met - that it never remained still, although its essence endures. ""No other city on earth has such a mania for tearing down the old to build the new - which I approve of.""Since she is most noted as a bibliophile, what she noticed most were the changes in the big bookstores. There have been many changes on that score since. Another, to a recent visitor, would be the explosion in the number of museums. She counted 42. There are more now. It is unfortunate that the best of the new ones - in some ways the best of them all - was not there for her to write about; her opinions of the East Side Tenement Museum would, no doubt, have been piquant.Since this book is not a guide, it makes no gesture to being comprehensive. Hanff cannot be dull, but ""Apple of My Eye"" is a good deal less charming than ""84, Charing Cross Road."" That volume grew organically and thus reflected Hanff's lively personality in an unforced way.This volume was forced - a spinoff from a commission to write captions for a bicentennial picture book - and suffers from it. In particular, the unifying theme is the story of two middle-aged Manhattanites determinedly visiting the tourist sites that New Yorkers never go to, and not only Grant's Tomb. But the girlish inability to read maps, find things in plain sight or find a place to eat becomes wearingly cute after a while.Come on. They're New Yorkers.

And there are those who have vowed to destroy it. In the Valley of the Time Tombs, where huge, brooding structures move backward through time, the Shrike waits for them all. On the eve of Armageddon, with the entire galaxy at war, seven pilgrims set forth on a final voyage to Hyperion seeking the answers to the unsolved riddles of their lives.

The word ""Beginning"" in the title is a bit misleading: you shouldn't approach this book without a solid grounding in Java and databases in general. True, the introductory chapters cover essential SQL and other database concepts, but there is a steady ramping-up in the difficulty level as the book progresses, and it doesn't ever really level off. For example, Lauinger's treatment of his own Java Layered Frameworks open-source project in Chapter 16 is long-winded and daunting. And the later chapters assume complete familiarity with XML, JavaBeans, Servlets, and other more ""advanced"" topics. So, all in all, for the JDBC beginner I think that this is not the best book to begin your explorations of JDBC.On the other hand, this is an exceptionally thorough book, very well written and with few typos. The authors are likeable, the price is affordable, the presentation and the coding are laid out well, the printing and binding excellent. So it may be just the book for you if you have the patience to plod through its 900 pages. Certainly, the book makes an excellent reference. However, it only covers the business logic of Java database applications. Most of the examples in the book are console-based programs for testing the business logic. There is no coverage of GUI-related topics, for example how to present data in a grid. As one of the authors remarks somewhere, their purpose in writing the book was not to present ""pretty GUI's"" but rather to concentrate on the internals, the business logic. While I can understand the importance of business logic, I also would have liked these experts to have given me some good pointers on how to present data in various data-aware controls in a GUI.

The Great Gatsby,"In The Great Gatsby F. Scott Fitzgerald captures the flamboyance, the carelessness and the cruelty of the wealthy during America's Jazz Age. Part of the Macmillan Collector’s Library; a series of stunning, clothbound, pocket sized classics with gold foiled edges and ribbon markers. These beautiful books make perfect gifts or a treat for any book lover. This beautiful Macmillan Collector's Library edition features an afterword by David Stuart Davies. The Great Gatsby lives mysteriously in a luxurious Long Island mansion, playing lavish host to hundreds of people. And yet no one seems to know him or how he became so rich. He is rumoured to be everything from a German spy to a war hero. People clamour for invitations to his wild parties. But Jay Gatsby doesn't heed them. He cares for one person alone - Daisy Buchanan, the woman he has waited for all his life. Little does he know that his infatuation will lead to tragedy and end in murder.",['F.

It's really a writers' textbook that teaches by example how to extend, invent, and use language in new and effective ways. For it's a rare book that gets this amount of meaning into a sentence and it's a rare book that has the dimensions and extraordinary intensity of impression that its paragraphs carry. Scenes blaze with life and it all goes by so fast I always end up with the feeling that I have finished a short story not a book. In Gatsby Fitzgerald is more in command and control than he is in all his other novels put together including The Last Tycoon, Tender is the Night, The Beautiful and the Damned, and This Side of Paradise. Gatsby is a novel with few false moves, a simple story and a simple plot. One might say almost perfect in structural simplicity, but the meanings are complex creating the suggestion that there is more, much more, under the surface, which incidentally there is. Part of the subtext is brought out by rich symbolism. Who will ever forget the weird eyes of T.J. Eckleburg looking over the wasteland of ash and what that means? Who will ever forget the green light at the end of Daisy's dock and what that means? If you haven't read this classic of twentieth-century literature, please read it.

Extinction: How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago,"Some 250 million years ago, the earth suffered the greatest biological crisis in its history. Around 95 percent of all living species died out—a global catastrophe far greater than the dinosaurs' demise 185 million years later. How this happened remains a mystery. But there are many competing theories. Some blame huge volcanic eruptions that covered an area as large as the continental United States; others argue for sudden changes in ocean levels and chemistry, including burps of methane gas; and still others cite the impact of an extraterrestrial object, similar to what caused the dinosaurs' extinction. Extinction is a paleontological mystery story. Here, the world's foremost authority on the subject provides a fascinating overview of the evidence for and against a whole host of hypotheses concerning this cataclysmic event that unfolded at the end of the Permian. After setting the scene, Erwin introduces the suite of possible perpetrators and the types of evidence paleontologists seek. He then unveils the actual evidence--moving from China, where much of the best evidence is found; to a look at extinction in the oceans; to the extraordinary fossil animals of the Karoo Desert of South Africa. Erwin reviews the evidence for each of the hypotheses before presenting his own view of what happened. Although full recovery took tens of millions of years, this most massive of mass extinctions was a powerful creative force, setting the stage for the development of the world as we know it today. In a new preface, Douglas Erwin assesses developments in the field since the book's initial publication.",['Douglas H. Erwin'],Princeton University Press,2015-03-22,['Science'],0691005249,A1XXJ6I7K2I7SI,24/25,5.0,1144368000,When Life Almost Didn't Make It,"Even kids now can tell you about the mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs. When I was a kid, the dinosaur extinction was a big mystery, but there has been good evidence, now broadly accepted, that 65 million years ago a meteor as big as a mountain smashed into the Yucatan, turning everything for miles around into ash, wrapping the world in a cloud, and blocking the sunlight that runs all life. Everything all over the world changed, and we mammals got our try at reproductive success. The horrendous extinction that ended the Cretaceous age, however, wasn't the worst our old Earth had seen. 250 million years ago, there was an extinction that ended the Permian and began the Triassic periods (which is also the border between the larger, more general Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras). This Permo-Triassic event extinguished around 95 percent of all living species, and was as close as we have ever come to having all life wiped out. In fact, in the 19th century, geologists thought that life had been wiped out and a separate creation had occurred to start the Triassic. What really happened, and how, are the subjects of _Extinction: How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago_ (Princeton University Press) by Douglas H. Erwin, Senior Scientist and Curator of the Department of Paleobiology at the Smithsonian. He has made the end-Permian mass extinction his research interest for the past twenty years, and has traveled all over the world to the fossil beds and geologic boundary layers remaining from around the time of the catastrophe. Looking back so many millions of years ago is not easy, and the picture is not as clear as that of the dinosaur extinction. Erwin's book, however, is a fine demonstration of how geologists and paleobiologists have come to some admittedly limited understanding of what happened.There are many factors that have been suspects in the great killing, and Erwin likes to think of himself as a detective out of Agatha Christie set to finger the actual culprit. It's not that easy, of course. Catastrophic explanations for the end-Permian abound, and Erwin's book is an examination of the more likely causes, about six of them. Of course, a main one, borrowing from the success of the impact explanation of 65 million years ago, is an extraterrestrial impact. It is certainly a plausible explanation, since it is accepted as the cause of the more recent extinction. There are problems, however. The impact that wiped out the dinosaurs left clues like an iridium layer in geological strata (there is lots of iridium in meteorites, not so much on Earth) and ""shocked quartz"" impact crystals, but such clues are lacking for the earlier event. Another explanation might be volcanism, resulting in dust and acidic chemicals and basalts that cover a countryside ""much as honey fills in the roughness of an English muffin."" Yet another is that continental drift (plate tectonics) was causing collisions at the time, forcing species that had not previously met each other to compete, and changing the global climate by newly formed landmasses. Vast glaciation may have caused cooling and a decrease in sea level. Perhaps there was a drop in oxygen levels of the oceans. Maybe sea levels dropped and caused a huge release of methane from sediments.He has not, however, wrapped everything up, as, say, Hercule Poirot might. He does, indeed, call his own proposal at explanation the _Murder on the Orient Express_ hypothesis, based on Agatha Christie's book which is a who-didn't-do-it rather than a whodunit. The explanation calls on aspects of many of the other explanations, but Erwin admits this makes it hard to test. One of his colleagues had dubbed it ""Erwin's kitchen sink hypothesis"", and, as Erwin says, was not being complimentary. There are implications for our own times in this story, since we are now in another period of great extinctions and our climate may be changing irrevocably, but Erwin does not stress these. His book is a fine summary of current thinking on the extinction. Readers will come up against sentences like, ""Some surviving ammonoids with extreme morphology died out in the Griesbachian, but new Dienerian ammonoids were more similar to the norm..."" (all the terms are well explained, but will be new to most readers), but then a few pages later readers will learn that the ""quality of many Early Triassic fossils is really pretty lousy."" There may be fewer hard answers here than in a murder mystery, but the explanations about how scientists came up with ideas about the extinction make this a fascinating look at experts confronting profound and distant mysteries.",2015,en

Middlemarch a Study of Provincial Life,"“Middlemarch - A Study of Provincial Life” is an 1871 novel by English author George Eliot. Set in the fictitious Midlands town of Middlemarch, the story revolves around the lives of its inhabitants in the years leading up to the Reform Act in 1832, particularly those of Dorothea Brooke, Tertius Lydgate, Nicholas Bulstrode, and Mary Garth. The novel deals with a variety of themes and issues including marriage, religion, hypocrisy, education, political reform, and the status of women. Although published to mixed reviews, Eliot's “Middlemarch” is now widely considered to be one of the greatest novels ever written in the English language. A veritable classic of English literature without which no bookshelf is complete. Mary Ann Evans (1819–1880), more commonly known as George Eliot, was an English poet, journalist, novelist, and translator. Among the most prominent writers in Victorian England, she wrote seven novels in total, most of which are known for their realism and psychological analyses of provincial English life. Other notable works by this author include: “Adam Bede” (1859), “The Mill on the Floss” (1860), and “Daniel Deronda” (1876). Read & Co.

He is best remembered as the author of Call of the Wild and White Fang, both set in the Klondike Gold Rush, as well as the short stories ""To Build a Fire"", ""An Odyssey of the North"", and ""Love of Life. He also wrote of the South Pacific in such stories as ""The Pearls of Parlay"" and ""The Heathen"", and of the San Francisco Bay area in The Sea Wolf. The Sea-Wolf is a 1904 psychological adventure about a literary critic and survivor of an ocean collision, who comes under the dominance of Wolf Larsen, the powerful and amoral sea captain who rescues him.

It's ironic that because of his dog-centric books that he is often written off as a children's author. I once made the mistake of taking a collection of his short stories on a vacation. Great stories, but among the most depressing, violent, cruel concepts ever put to paper. A poor fit with frozen drinks and palm trees.The Sea Wolf is one of my favorite books largely on the basis of the villian, Wolf Larsen. He stands unique among villians in that he is huge, powerful, intelligent, ambitious, aggressive, with no muzzle of a conscience. He is omnipotent. Absolute power corupting absolutely. He is not a dumb brute that our intellectual hero outwits or outworks. Were it not for the peripheral factors of his even more destructive brother, or his failing health, he would have remained the master of his domain. I would expect that this Alpha male nature of Larsen that led London to name him Wolf.One of the biggest casting crimes ever committed by Hollywood was the casting of E.G. Robinson as Wolf and then remaking it with Bronson many years later (apparently based on having watched the original movie without really understanding the book).",2013,en

Death in the Afternoon,"Still considered one of the best books ever written about bullfighting, Death in the Afternoon is an impassioned look at the sport by one of its true aficionados. It reflects Hemingway's conviction that bullfighting was more than mere sport and reveals a rich source of inspiration for his art. The unrivaled drama of bullfighting, with its rigorous combination of athleticism and artistry, and its requisite display of grace under pressure, ignited Hemingway's imagination. Here he describes and explains the technical aspects of this dangerous ritual and “the emotional and spiritual intensity and pure classic beauty that can be produced by a man, an animal, and a piece of scarlet serge draped on a stick.” Seen through his eyes, bullfighting becomes a richly choreographed ballet, with performers who range from awkward amateurs to masters of great elegance and cunning. A fascinating look at the history and grandeur of bullfighting, Death in the Afternoon is also a deeper contemplation of the nature of cowardice and bravery, sport and tragedy, and is enlivened throughout by Hemingway's sharp commentary on life and literature.",['Ernest Hemingway'],Simon and Schuster,2014-05-22,['Literary Criticism'],B000JWW1UG,AIHBELNQRGPVD,0/0,4.0,1350086400,death in the afternoon,"I enjoyed the first part of the book all about the ceremony, drama & skill of the fights.

Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain and her family may live in a ramshackle old English castle, but that’s about as romantic as her life gets.

Why I Breathe . . .,"A New York Times Bestseller A Washington Post Notable Nonfiction Book of 2020 Named a Best Book of 2020 by NPR “A fascinating scientific, cultural, spiritual and evolutionary history of the way humans breathe—and how we’ve all been doing it wrong for a long, long time.” —Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Big Magic and Eat Pray Love No matter what you eat, how much you exercise, how skinny or young or wise you are, none of it matters if you’re not breathing properly. There is nothing more essential to our health and well-being than breathing: take air in, let it out, repeat twenty-five thousand times a day. Yet, as a species, humans have lost the ability to breathe correctly, with grave consequences. Journalist James Nestor travels the world to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it. The answers aren’t found in pulmonology labs, as we might expect, but in the muddy digs of ancient burial sites, secret Soviet facilities, New Jersey choir schools, and the smoggy streets of São Paulo. Nestor tracks down men and women exploring the hidden science behind ancient breathing practices like Pranayama, Sudarshan Kriya, and Tummo and teams up with pulmonary tinkerers to scientifically test long-held beliefs about how we breathe. Modern research is showing us that making even slight adjustments to the way we inhale and exhale can jump-start athletic performance; rejuvenate internal organs; halt snoring, asthma, and autoimmune disease; and even straighten scoliotic spines. None of this should be possible, and yet it is. Drawing on thousands of years of medical texts and recent cutting-edge studies in pulmonology, psychology, biochemistry, and human physiology, Breath turns the conventional wisdom of what we thought we knew about our most basic biological function on its head. You will never breathe the same again.",['James Nestor'],Penguin,2020-05-26,['Science'],1403347743,A2HTT3QJUM4KWZ,0/0,4.0,1042156800,keepin' it real.,"I'm still, I'm still crying from this book.

A Land Remembered,"A Land Remembered has been ranked #1 Best Florida Book eight times in annual polls conducted by Florida Monthly Magazine. In this best-selling novel, Patrick Smith tells the story of three generations of the MacIveys, a Florida family who battle the hardships of the frontier to rise from a dirt-poor Cracker life to the wealth and standing of real estate tycoons. The story opens in 1858, when Tobias MacIvey arrives in the Florida wilderness to start a new life with his wife and infant son, and ends two generations later in 1968 with Solomon MacIvey, who realizes that the land has been exploited far beyond human need. The sweeping story that emerges is a rich, rugged Florida history featuring a memorable cast of crusty, indomitable Crackers battling wild animals, rustlers, Confederate deserters, mosquitoes, starvation, hurricanes, and freezes to carve a kingdom out of the swamp. But their most formidable adversary turns out to be greed, including finally their own. Love and tenderness are here too: the hopes and passions of each new generation, friendships with the persecuted blacks and Indians, and respect for the land and its wildlife. A Land Remembered was winner of the Florida Historical Society's Tebeau Prize as the Most Outstanding Florida Historical Novel. Now in its 14th hardcover printing, it has been in print since 1984 and is also available in trade paperback.",['Patrick D.

That's a reasonable point of view--Senator Kerry himself thinks he went too far at that time.Instead of engaging in that argument, though, the vets were hijacked by amoral political hacks (these ones happen to be Republicans, but there are plenty on both sides) and talked into participating in this libelous character assassination. The fact that the ridiculous charges raised in this book--which have been definitively refuted by a tremendous amount of evidence--are given any credibility at all sickens me.

I collected secrets like other women collected bells; afraid to fully trust lest my oddities be exposed. Until I saw him. He'd been gliding down the street, unshakable confidence in every step. It wasn't just that he was breathtakingly handsome with perfect features. Something about him drew me. Sucked my focus to him and then tugged at my body. As his eyes met mine, I was entrapped. No one had noticed him. He'd been right there, just beyond the light, but only I had perceived. I had to know if he was real. Or maybe I really was crazy.

I think this worked better in 'The Case of the Toxic Spell Dump' and 'Thessalonica' than it does here. In these other two books Turtledove treated the idea with humour and it worked. In this book he takes the idea altogether too seriously, and it just gets to the point where you are left wondering what difference it makes? This book might as well have been a tale of World War Two, and nothing more has really been added to the story by making it on a different world and using magic instead of technology. What difference does it make if you are flying on a dragon having dogfights and dropping bombs, or flying an aircraft? The only thing that I found interesting about this story was trying to place who was who (eg which state is Russia, which is Germany etc.) and I'm afraid it wasn't all that hard to spot. If you are going to write allegory, it ought to be a bit more subtle than this. There was, for example a small state which fought a war with the alternate 'USSR' and it was a desert nation, but it was pretty obvious that it was supposed to be Finland. There is even a minority people all set up to play the role of the Jews...I've just been rereading Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' and I think Turtledove would do well to read his comments in the preface about the role of allegory in writing a story, and how he expressly denies trying to parallel it to the war, despite writing much of it during those years. 'Lord of the Rings' works better for it, and if Turtledove is going to write of fictional worlds I wish he would really do that. This was just too close to WWII, and he's already treated the WWII theme pretty thoroughly in his 4 books series of alien invasion.",2014,en

Education and Peace,"The growing literature on Peace Education reflects a dynamic filed. Since the early decades of the 20th century, “Peace Education” programmes around the world have represented a number of focal themes, including anti-nuclearism, environmental responsibility, international understanding, communication skills, non-violence, human right awareness, democracy, conflict resolution techniques, tolerance of diversity, co-existence and gender equality among others. Peace Education includes cultivation of peacebuilding skills, e.g. dialogue, mediation, artistic endeavors. Peace educators, then teach the value of respect, understanding and nonviolence, present skills for analyzing international conflict, educate for alternative security systems and use a pedagogy that is democratic and particular. Thus, peace education as a practice and philosophy refers to matching complementary element between education and society, where the social purpose (i.e. why teach), educative process are conducive to fostering peace. Accordingly, peace education is dialogical experience conducted through participatory learning, where learners communally and co-operatively grapple with contemporary issues (i.e., talking points) related to local and global contexts (Akaamaa, 2013).",[' Dr. Bimal Charan Swain & Dr. Rajalakshmi Das'],Ashok Yakkaldevi,2020-07-01,['Art'],B0006C4K9O,A1Z9L6HT5YWI8B,4/4,5.0,1269561600,"Insightful, inspiring, relevant today as ever","Dr. Maria Montessori lays out a vision of education as the path to peace.

It was a fascinating read and I found myself deeply absorbed in this book due to its accessibility, eloquence and succinct style on an otherwise complex topic. The comprehensive way in which Bulkeley organized each subject matter, as well as how he introduced each theorist, was extremely helpful to me. I now have a better understanding of such complex figures as Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and Frederick Perls and have discovered new pioneers in this field that I might have otherwise dismissed as being ""over my head."" For example, Stephen LaBerge, Ann Faraday and Gayle Delaney, who take a more modern approach to the dream but in very unique directions, are just a few I will look out for in my own research.One of the most fascinating aspects of this book was when Dr. Bulkeley psychoanalyzed his own dream by using various theorists and their personal methodologies. I appreciated seeing the dream viewed in diverse (and surprisingly objective) ways which reminds me of the value of my own dream group in terms of gathering various perspectives. The dream itself is both rich and complex and Bulkeley's process illustrated the many layers of the dream on a personal, communal and global scale. This exercise relates to Justina Lasley's theory in that an individual can work on just one dream for her entire life. I also realize that we can learn from all perspectives even though we might not agree with them like a Crick, Mitchison or Foulkes who believe dreams carry no significant higher meaning or intention. This amazing task demonstrates Dr. Bulkeley's impressive wealth of knowledge as well as his own keen insight into dreamsThere is a healthy need to challenge dream theories just as we, the dreamer, challenge the ""shadow"" parts of our many selves. Bulkeley notes these psychological debates in three main areas of Form, Function and Interpretation (how are dreams created, what's their significance and, finally, what does it all mean?) are clearly and thankfully ongoing. As more interest and discussion in dreaming are produced so new leaders and enterprising research studies. This is an exciting time for dreamers like Kelly Bulkeley and I can see An Introduction to the Psychology of Dreaming becoming an indispensable resource for my own personal journey.",2017,en

But for these authors the language itself IS the action. Nothing happens and yet everything happens. Just as their work tends to shy away from the conventions of the novel, I believe they are to be read just as unconventionally as they were written. Specifically, The Waves reads like the longest prose poem in the history of the language. When read as a &quot;novel&quot; it does indeed become every bit as difficult as a lot of readers say it is. Though Woolf attempts to differentiate between characters as though straining to achieve at least the skeletal image of the &quot;novel,&quot; she does this only superficially by drifting from one name to another. The unwavering language maintains precisely the same tone and intensity throughout, and the focus of Woolf's lucid inquiry never drifts far from its central themes. The book is a series of dramatic monologues that blend indistinguishably into one another. Woolf was preoccupied here with mortality, transience, loneliness and the meaning of friendship, not with telling a story (though a story does get told in the process). As a poem, though, it reads like a great lost chapter of the Bible; a curious, explosive and inward lexicon of the human experience so sacred in its expression as to be humanly impossible. &quot;All mists curl off the roof of my being,&quot; Woolf muses in one of the book's most gorgeous lines. It is a perfect description of the alert reader's response: an exuberance bordering on epiphany. If Dickinson is right and the great poem makes one feel as though the top of one's head has been sawn off, then The Waves is a great poem. There have been many great writers, but few who approach the eloquent desperation of this text.",2016,en

First, you can definitely tell that this book is written for young adults. Even more so than other young adult novels out there. It's simplistic and full of moral preaching.

Seriously? Just.. boom, a confession and then everything gets turned around? It just felt all too neat and tidy.

Despite conflicts with her strict aunt Elizabeth, Emily finds solace in writing and in nature, and eventually makes friends with hot-tempered tomboy Ilse Burnley, artist Teddy Kent, and a hired boy on the farm, Perry Miller.

Wanneer hij een van Juliets brieven vindt, ontstaat een bijzondere briefwisseling, die zich al snel uitbreidt naar mail en app. Op papier en beeldscherm vertellen Juliet en Declan elkaar alles, denkend dat ze elkaar nog nooit ontmoet hebben.

She can calibrate it from Texas twang to enchantingly low, well modulated to an almost whisper-like caress. Thus, it is always a pleasure to hear her read an audio book. That pleasure is doubled when her narrative is as fine as the one penned by Marry McGarry Morris.With a story set in rural Vermont during the Depression era we meet two young ones, Thomas Talcott, 12, and his sister, Margaret, 8. Their father, Henry, met the fate of so many others - he lost everything and now must try to earn sustenance as a traveling butcher. The children's mother, Irene, has abandoned them, leaving a desolate Henry, and two confused, unhappy youngsters.Henry's attempts to support himself and his family fail miserably, thus the little family is reduced to living in a tent. There are overtures by a well-to-do neighbor to help them, perhaps as playmates for her sick son. However, the terms of that offer may be more than Henry can countenance.Judith Ivey gives a touching, award worthy reading of ""The Lost Mother.""- Gail Cooke",2017,en

Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK,"Pulitzer Prize Finalist: “By far the most lucid and compelling account . . . of what probably did happen in Dallas—and what almost certainly did not.” —The New York Times Book Review The Kennedy assassination has reverberated for five decades, with tales of secret plots, multiple killers, and government cabals often overshadowing the event itself. As Gerald Posner writes, “Fifty years after the assassination, the biggest casualty has been the truth.” In this first-ever digital edition of his classic work, updated with a special comment for the fiftieth anniversary, Posner lays to rest all of the convoluted conspiracy theories—concerning the mafia, a second shooter, and the CIA—that have obscured over the decades what really happened in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963. Drawing from official sources and dozens of interviews, and filled with powerful historical detail, Case Closed is a vivid and straightforward account that stands as one of the most authoritative books on the assassination of John F. Kennedy.",['Gerald Posner'],Open Road Media,2013-10-01,['History'],0785731261,A3KZ6E61U65FO1,4/8,5.0,1298851200,Look at Oswald,"Having read a few books on the assassination which support a conspiracy, or at least question the official story, I thought I'd check out Ponser's book as support of the ""lone assassin"" point of view. Although I usually read novels, I found this to be a page turner in its own right. It is both concise and detailed.Part of the appeal of this book, as opposed to other books about November 22, 1963, is that it has a clean, ""here's who did it, this is why, this is how"" approach. On a very basic level, that appeals to most people. As an amateur on the subject, I do not have to wonder as much about the validity of sole sources, or speculate for myself as to what evidence leads to which person, and which possible conspiracy.A good deal of attention is given to Oswald's background and his character from the words of people who knew him and interacted with him. To me, he is now the weakest link in any conspiracy theory. A depressed drifter, pathological liar, wife beater, socio path, and one largely dependent on the government dole, is going to be part of an (inter)national conspiracy? A guy who was busted down to janitor in his last months in the Marines, a guy who did not even have a driver's license, a guy living apart from his wife and a new-born baby because of domestic troubles, and a failure at most everything he tried, is going to suddenly be trusted by experienced criminals to help perpetrate the crime of the century? Really?!There might be inconsistencies with evidence, and some things will remain suspicious. I refuse to be closed-minded about it, as questioning our government and its history is vital. The study of Oswald as a person is the strongest aspect of the book and was very eye-opening for me. Oswald always wanted to be somebody and always had ideas larger than his ability to carry them out. Sorry, but we all have met this type of person. Yet, somehow, not only did he get what he wanted - being entered in the history books - but also, with so many people believing in a conspiracy, gets the assumption of innocence too. Think of how sad this is, if he truly did act alone.",2013,en

Kushiel's Dart,"Fifty Shades of Grey meets Game of Thrones, Kushiel's Dart is the first in a triptych of beautifully constructed historical fantasies that combine passion, danger, great battles, and deep eroticism. The land of Terre d’Ange is a place of unsurpassing beauty and grace. It is said that the angels found the land and saw it was good... and the ensuing race that rose from the seed of angels and men live by one simple rule: Love as thou wilt. Phèdre nó Delaunay is a young woman who was born with a scarlet mote in her left eye and sold into indentured servitude as a child. Her bond is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, a nobleman with a very special mission... and the first one to recognize who and what she is: one pricked by Kushiel’s Dart, chosen to forever experience pain and pleasure as one. Phèdre is trained equally in the courtly arts and the talents of the bedchamber, but, above all, in the ability to observe, remember, and analyze. Almost as talented a spy as she is a courtesan, Phèdre stumbles upon a plot that threatens the very foundation of her homeland. Treachery sets her on her path; love and honor goad her further and will take her to the edge of despair... and beyond. Hateful friend, loving enemy, beloved assassin; they can all wear the same glittering mask in this world, and Phèdre will get but one chance to save all that she holds dear. Set in a world of cunning poets, deadly courtiers, heroic traitors, and a truly Machiavellian villainess, this is a novel of grandeur, luxuriance, sacrifice, betrayal, and deeply laid conspiracies.

Her interaction with Joscelin I really enjoyed. Out of all the characters I enjoyed Joscelin the most actually. The sexual content of this book is mentioned by many who have read the book. It's there in varying degrees, especially in the first part of the book. The author did a good job of making such scenes interesting, though erotic is not the word I would use to describe them. Apparently many people would. I finished this book out of determination and not much else, and I have no intention of reading the rest of the series. Where the sterling reviews come from I can't say.

SILENCE,"The riveting story of the American scientists, tinkerers, and nerds who solved one of the biggest puzzles of World War II—and developed one of the most powerful weapons of the war 12 Seconds of Silence is the remarkable, lost story of how a ragtag group of American scientists overcame one of the toughest problems of World War II: shooting things out of the sky. Working in a secretive organization known as Section T, a team of physicists, engineers, and everyday Joes and Janes took on a devilish challenge. To help the Allies knock airplanes out of the air, they created one of the world’s first “smart weapons.” Against overwhelming odds and in a race against time, mustering every scrap of resource, ingenuity, and insight, the scientists of Section T would eventually save countless lives, rescue the city of London from the onslaught of a Nazi superweapon, and help bring about the Axis defeat. A holy grail sought after by Allied and Axis powers alike, their unlikely innovation ranks with the atomic bomb as one of the most revolutionary technologies of the Second World War. Until now, their tale was largely untold. For fans of Erik Larson and Ben Macintyre, set amidst the fog of espionage, dueling spies, and the dawn of an age when science would determine the fate of the world, 12 Seconds of Silence is a tribute to the extraordinary wartime mobilization of American science and the ultimate can-do story.",['Jamie Holmes'],HarperCollins,2020-08-04,['History'],B000PGIL1O,A1Y63VINXUSLTP,2/6,4.0,1238976000,Suffering and the silence of God,"Where is God?

Heinlein's greatest works, The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress rose from the golden age of science fiction to become an undisputed classic—and a touchstone for the philosophy of personal responsibility and political freedom. A revolution on a lunar penal colony—aided by a self-aware supercomputer—provides the framework for a story of a diverse group of men and women grappling with the ever-changing definitions of humanity, technology, and free will—themes that resonate just as strongly today as they did when the novel was first published. The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress gives readers an extraordinary, thought-provoking glimpse into the mind of Robert A. Heinlein, who, even now, “shows us where the future is” (Tom Clancy).",['Robert A.

Even with the political speeches, Heinlein remains the most approachable of writers. He's not beating the reader about the head with libertarianism - the politics is integral to the story, in some cases, it is the story.The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress introduced the concept of ""rational anarchism"", which had existed but had no name up to that point. Briefly, the rational anarchist realizes that some government is necessary, but any government is dangerous, and must be watched as closely as a rabid dog.The plot follows the citizens of Earth's Moon, as they attempt to avoid a looming food shortage by throwing off the shackles of the World Government that keeps them enslaved and exiled. Manuel, a computer technician, joins up with Wyoming ( a professional surrogate mother turned political agitator) and Professor de la Paz as the first cell of a revolutionary movement. The story of Luna's revolution is told with the terrible costs of war in mind, but also with the type of detail that makes a compelling read. We know from the first page that the 'Loonies' are successful, but getting there is all the fun.The Loonies, mostly miners and farmers, speak in a mixture of 'Strine' and 'authentic frontier gibberish', heavily influenced by Soviet and Russian speech patterns and idioms. This makes it a little hard to follow the narrator until the reader hits his stride. Also, the novel was written in the Sixties, so you're not going to see a lot of sex and violence - though the depictions of polygamy were very shocking back then!Many Science Fiction writers have an appreciation for liberty - David Weber, Orson Scott Card, and El Neil spring to mind. It must be that longing for the freedom of space, (the final frontier, as some wag put it) awakens the yearning for pure, God-given freedom. Possibly, it's the other way around.For pure SF fun with a good dose of 'classical liberal' thought and economics, Robert Anson Heinlein can't be beat, and The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress is one of his best.",2018,en

Only Yesterday: An Informal History of the Nineteen-Twenties,"A history of roaring prosperity—and economic cataclysm: “The one account of America in the 1920s against which all others must be measured” (The Washington Post). Beginning November 11, 1918, when President Woodrow Wilson declared the end of World War I in a letter to the American public, and continuing through his defeat, Prohibition, the Big Red Scare, the rise of women’s hemlines, and the stock market crash of 1929, Only Yesterday, published just two years after the crash, chronicles a decade like no other.

In this spirit also, prohibition was passed. The moment the war came to an end, the American people fled from the banners of decency just as fast as their legs could carry them. The government became a derelict hulk captained by token presidents.Wilson drove himself to death trying in vain to bring about a ""just and lasting peace."" Harding, the great American ""good guy"", enmeshed himself in the ""Teapot Dome Scandals"" perpetrated by his friends, the Texas oil millionaires. The author speculates that his rather unexpected death was a concealed suicide. The oil intended for U.S. naval reserves went elsewhere at a large profit, much to Japan.The south rose again in the form of the resurrected Klu Klux Klan (the book does not mention its previous disbanding by the actual confederate veterans). They ruled at the state and local levels (hence ""states rights""). Justice was an open joke, but who cared about it? The American people were busy pursuing a sexual revolution and illicit booze. The satirist, H. L. Mencken, had a field day. Al Capone ruled Chicago. Hundreds of rackets sprang up everywhere and small businessmen paid taxes to the mob.Why did the government not act? Mammon was God and was being preached not only by the clergy from the pulpit but by its new apostles, the salesmen. ""Hands off"", they said, and that will be the best. The little people attempted to defend themselves and their jobs through unions and were assaulted by reactionary forces acting at state and local levels. Anarchy and disorder were on the increase. The IWW reached maximum extent, especially in the west. Reactionaries countered with ""the red scare."" Sacco and Vanzetti were executed for a crime the judge and prosecutor knew they did not commit, because they were ""anarchists"" (they were not).Reaching the end of the decade, the author gives us the handwriting on the wall: the crash of late 1929. Laissez faire, he hints, was not going to work in the 20th century. He could not then know of the rise of FDR, the suppression of the Klan, the legalization of unions, and the strengthening of the government into a social regulatory force and quasi-empire. Nor could he know that the divisiveness would continue, and the protagonists would be roughly the same. What a pity.",2015,en
"Warrior Woman: The Story of Lozen, Apache Warrior and Shaman","Warrior Woman is the story of Lozen, sister of the famous Apache warrior Victorio, and warrior in her own right. Hers is a story little discussed in Native American history books. Instead, much of what is known of her has been passed down through generations via stories and legends. For example, it is said that she was embued with supernatural powers, given to her by the gods. She would lift her arms to the sky and place her palms against the wind, and through the heat she felt in her open hands, she could detect the direction and distance of her enemies. Whether true or not, she did ride into battle alongside Geronimo in the Apache wars, and fought bitterly and savagely until she was captured along with her people, packed into railroad cars, and sent to imprisonment in the east, where she spent her last days. Peter Aleshire uses historical facts and oral histories to recreate her life. With immaculate detail he tells the story of her childhood, surrounded by the vastness of nature and the Chiricahua legends and religions that shaped her thoughts. He describes her coming-of-age ceremonies, and induction into her tribe as a spiritual leader. As the white men slowly took over the land of her people and forced them from one reservation to another, her role slowly evolved to match that of the staunchest warrior -- an almost unheard-of occurence among the Native Americans of the 19th century, where a woman's place was with the children in the villages. This is not only the story of Lozen, but the story of her people, from the events leading up to the Apache Wars until their inevitable and unfortunate conclusion.",['Peter Aleshire'],St. Martin's Press,2015-06-30,['Biography & Autobiography'],0312244088,A3K95QQ7YO29VQ,0/0,5.0,1360454400,"Warrior Woman: The Story of Lozen, Apache Warrior","Having already read and hearing more of this woman &#34;Lozen&#34;, I am very thrilled to own this true life story of Lozen.

I thought that it would be easy. It wasn't. Unless you are really interested in worms or insects or crabs then there is a good possibility that you might not really like a class like this and would recommend taking a different population/diversity class instead. The class that I took included both lecture and lab examinations which I thought were rather difficult. It wasn't really my thing and I didn't really find it that thrilling.The textbook includes the major phyla of the invertebrates: Molluscs, Echinoderms, Arthropods, etc; as well as several minor phyla and a number of invertebrate classes. The photographs are in black and white and there are a number of drawings of the anatomy of invertebrates, as well as many tables and graphs. However, the book is in my opinion a rather slim volume and much information about specific classes are families is largely omitted. Also, the book chooses to first present information about the different classes and orders in a phyla and then presents informations about respiration, digestion, and other bodily processes at the end of the chapter, which I found confusing. It would seem easier to just talk about the processes while discussing the specific classes or orders.I wouldn't really say that this book is sufficient for the lab portion of a class like this. The drawings are ok and useful for identifying some slides and specimens, but you will probably cover animals in lab that aren't in the book. I used a general biology lab book when I took this class, but included very few slides that we actually looked at, and only about half of the dissections that we preformed. I would recommend buying a specific Invertebrate Zoology lab book, if you can find one.If you pay attention in lecture and are good at drawing pictures of specimens in lab, then this book is probably suffient for you to do well in an invertebrate class. If you have problems paying attention in lecture and have difficulty telling one worm from another (like I did often) then you might want to check some other books out from the library that go into more detail.",2014,en
Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass First published in 1845, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass is an eye-opening depiction of American slavery. Part autobiography, part human-rights treatise, it describes the everyday horrors inflicted on captive laborers, as well as the strength and courage needed to survive. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Born into slavery on a Maryland plantation in 1818, Frederick Douglass spent years secretly teaching himself to read and write—a crime for which he risked life and limb. After two failed escapes, Douglass finally, blessedly boarded a train in 1838 that would eventually lead him to New York City and freedom. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Few books have done more to change America’s notion of African Americans than this seminal work. Beyond its historical and social relevancy, it is admired today for its gripping stories, the intensity of spirit, and heartfelt humanity. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass This ebook has been professionally proofread to ensure accuracy and readability on all devices. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Born into a life of bondage, Frederick Douglass secretly taught himself to read and write.

"Electric Motors and Drives, Second Edition","Written for non-specialist users of electric motors and drives, this book explains how electric drives work and compares the performance of the main systems, with many examples of applications.

Electric Motors and Drives is for non-specialist users of electric motors and drives. It fills the gap between specialist textbooks (which are pitched at a level which is too academic for the average user) and the more prosaic 'handbooks' which are filled with useful detail but provide little opportunity for the development of any real insight or understanding.

The best thing about the series is the sense of being drawn into a charming world through Brian Jacques' vivid descriptions, rich vocabulary, and use of epithets and reoccurring scenes and character traits that create a sense of familiarity and connection to the Redwall world for the reader. Identifying the parts of the typical Redwall framework adds a layer of interest to listening to the story. The down side is (for the adult reader at any rate) the stories can become too predictable and the characters less archetype and more stereotype. There is no question as to which characters are Good and which are Evil, it's embedded in their species, and that sort of simplification tends to make the story slightly less compelling (for me, at least).Regarding ""Mossflower"" in particular, the storyline was consistantly entertaining, but there were some weaknesses with characters - I didn't find Martin to be that compelling as a hero, given his legendary status in the other books. The scenes with the Bad Guys were repetitive and Tsarmina was not a very nuanced antagonist, not a good leader, or much of a threat to the Good Guys - in contrast to Cluny in ""Redwall"" who was a fun character to watch and a viable threat. But even in ""Redwall"" the scenes with the villains were fairly one-note. Possibly it's the author's intent to make the evil side seem boring and futile and predictable, and the villains as dumb, easily led, and self-defeating. But for me the lack of subtlety takes away from the story.""Mossflower"" didn't live up to ""Redwall"" in my estimation, but the Redwall world is fun to be drawn into all the same.",2012,en

The 158 Pound Marriage,"“Irving looks cunningly beyond the eye-catching gyrations of the mating dance to the morning-after implications.”—The Washington Post The darker vision and sexual ambiguities of this sensual, ironic tale about a ménage a quatre in a New England university town foreshadow those of The World According to Garp; but this very trim and precise novel is a marked departure from the author's generally robust, boisterous style. Though Mr. Irving's cool eye spares none of his foursome, he writes with genuine compassion for the sexual tests and illusions they perpetrate on each other; but the sexual intrigue between them demonstrates how even the kind can be ungenerous, and even the well-intentioned, destructive. “One of the most remarkable things about John Irving's first three novels, viewed from the vantage of The World According to Garp, is that they can be read as one extended fictional enterprise. . . .

One morning, Deming Guo’s mother, Polly, an undocumented Chinese immigrant, goes to her job at a nail salon—and never comes home. No one can find any trace of her. With his mother gone, eleven-year-old Deming is left mystified and bereft. Eventually adopted by a pair of well-meaning white professors, Deming is moved from the Bronx to a small town upstate and renamed Daniel Wilkinson. But far from all he’s ever known, Daniel struggles to reconcile his adoptive parents’ desire that he assimilate with his memories of his mother and the community he left behind. Told from the perspective of both Daniel—as he grows into a directionless young man—and Polly, Ko’s novel gives us one of fiction’s most singular mothers. Loving and selfish, determined and frightened, Polly is forced to make one heartwrenching choice after another. Set in New York and China, The Leavers is a vivid examination of borders and belonging.

The characters are astonishingly well developed and the plots are crafted with amazing precision.

The reader unfamiliar with Indian customs and traditions (as I am) need not fear -- Ms. Lahiri skillfully integrates any required cultural information into the text so that any reader will understand these stories. In fact, I learned a great deal about Indian culture just by reading this book.Many of the stories also deal with the conflict that American children feel because their cultural heritage is so different from that of their Indian-born parents. The author also focuses on the struggles that Indian immigrants face here in the United States.

""Swift has involved us in real, lived lives...Quietly, but with conviction, he seeks to affirm the values of decency, loyalty, love.""--New York Review of Books ""A beautiful book...a novel that speaks profoundly of human need and tenderness.

Commonly, they are unable to 'talk' about their feeling that Swift reveals to us as thoughts only; a tragic failure so many readers can identify with. Too often, the conversation between close friends in the book is barbed and sarcastic rather than warm.

Snow Country,"Nobel Prize winner Yasunari Kawabata’s Snow Country is widely considered to be the writer’s masterpiece: a powerful tale of wasted love set amid the desolate beauty of western Japan.

"Atlantis, The Lost Continent Finally Found","The late author Arysio Santos was a highly regarded climatologist, geologist, and nuclear physicist. He was also a scholar of history, folklore, languages, and the occult. In this groundbreaking study of Atlantis, he draws on all these disciplines, as well as ancient maps, Plato’s dialogues, and folkloric narratives, to provide the most compelling case yet of the disappearance of an entire civilization. Professor Santos demonstrates that Plato’s dating of Atlantis’s disappearance in 11,600 BP (before present) precisely corresponds to the catastrophic end of the Pleistocene Ice Age, as well as a historic flood event of cataclysmic proportions. The rising of the sea level by nearly 500 feet, he argues, submerged continent-sized lands—including Atlantis, which he connects with the biblical Garden of Eden. Provocative chapters cover such topics as the continent’s appearance in ancient maps, Indonesia as the true site of Eden, American interpretations of Atlantis, the four rivers of paradise, and more, giving a clear form to the ghostly outline of this fabled land.",['Arysio Santos'],North Atlantic Books,2011-03-01,"['Body, Mind & Spirit']",0976955008,A1Q45QNLYJ43CY,18/21,5.0,1149724800,Essential reading on Atlantis,"In Atlantis: The Lost Continent Finally Found, Professor Arysio Santos makes a persuasive and well researched case for Atlantis being in the region of Indonesia. In going through this masterful and erudite work, the reader will find his preconceptions challenged. Plato said that Atlantis lay beyond the Pillars of Hercules. We tend to assume that the Pillars or Hercules are located at the Straits of Gibraltar, but Santos, relying on careful study of ancient texts, shows that the name Pillars of Hercules in ancient times was applied to many locations. Santos makes a convincing case that the best fit for the Pillars of Hercules is the Sunda Straits connecting the Indian Ocean with the Pacific.

On Photography,"‘Nog altijd domineert Over fotografie het denken over fotografie. De schrijfstijl is vintage Sontag: trefzeker, stoer en stellig. Ze bracht de angsten en ambivalenties die veel mensen voelen tegenover moderne technologie in het algemeen, en fotografie in het bijzonder, messcherp onder woorden. Zelfs nu kun je amper een column, recensie of boek over fotografie lezen waarin Sontag niet wordt aangehaald – zeker wanneer het over foto’s van oorlog, honger of geweld gaat.’ – Lynn Berger in De Correspondent Over fotografie is een boeiend relaas over wat foto’s eigenlijk zijn, over esthetische en morele problemen waarmee we door hun alomtegenwoordigheid in onze mediacultuur worden geconfronteerd en over de (on)bedoelde effecten van fotografie. Het is een klassiek geworden, baanbrekend onderzoek naar de rol en de betekenis van beelden. Sontag weet het moderne leven zo scherpzinnig te vangen dat kritische vragen niet uit kunnen blijven. ‘Sontag heeft ons als geen ander geleerd na te denken over de rol en het effect van fotografie in onze tijd. Prachtige essays.’ – Trouw ‘Een mijlpaal in de reflectie over fotografie. De opstellen over camp en pornografie zijn virtuoos.’ – De Tijd ‘Over fotografie is het origineelste en meest verlichte boek over dit onderwerp.’ – The New Yorker ‘Elke pagina roept belangrijke en prikkelende vragen op, en bespreekt die vervolgens op de beste, briljante manier.’ – The New York Times Book Review",['Susan Sontag'],Singel Uitgeverijen,2019-10-01,['Literary Criticism'],B000HISB6A,AFDKTAGWMV8OW,4/5,3.0,1197331200,Choppy monograph - interesting ideas,"Sontag's On Photography was published in 1977. It includes six named sections which each tackle a slightly different subject. The sections were published independently as magazine articles years before the monograph was assembled--and this is plainly evident (which is my main 'complaint' about the text). The book does not feel or read like a book. It reads like a collection of six disparate essays that have been lightly edited for packaging as a book. The sections work OK as essays, but they fail somewhat as a monograph. For example, Sontag makes numerous assertions about photography which are stated as fact but not supported by any documentary evidence. While this is acceptable in an essay, in a monograph of this sort one would expect more academic rigor. Finally, each essay was clearly intended as an atomic piece and their collection in the book results in a large amount of re-hash of basic ideas at the start of every new section, as well as a very choppy flow between sections.The book is dated (which is entirely understandable--but true none-the-less). Sontag makes a single fleeting reference to digital photography as a quirky alternate method of capturing images. The text's discussion on the pervasive nature of cameras assumes the pinnacle of technology to be the Kodak Brownie. While this was arguably once true, photography has been so changed by digital capture and truly pervasive cameras (think cell phones, etc.) that many of the ideas of the text are only partially developed by today's standards. Additionally, Sontag's insistence that photography is the accidental but obvious champion of the Surrealist takeover of the arts is also dated. Sontag's insistence on using 'big' words and complicated sentences to describe simple things is also somewhat irritating; the tone is unmistakably that of 1970s/1980s critical academia.Having said that, the book occupies a fairly unique niche in the history of thinking about photography. As other reviews have noted, the subject material is (ahem) well focused on the topic and delivers interesting insight into various aspects of photography. It is unfortunate that Sontag did not more-fully edit the source materials into a cohesive text and at least attempt to look forward to a time when technological changes in process and artistic developments in taste could perhaps be different than the norms of the late 1970s.",2019,en
Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass First published in 1845, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass is an eye-opening depiction of American slavery. Part autobiography, part human-rights treatise, it describes the everyday horrors inflicted on captive laborers, as well as the strength and courage needed to survive. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Born into slavery on a Maryland plantation in 1818, Frederick Douglass spent years secretly teaching himself to read and write—a crime for which he risked life and limb. After two failed escapes, Douglass finally, blessedly boarded a train in 1838 that would eventually lead him to New York City and freedom. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Few books have done more to change America’s notion of African Americans than this seminal work. Beyond its historical and social relevancy, it is admired today for its gripping stories, the intensity of spirit, and heartfelt humanity. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass This ebook has been professionally proofread to ensure accuracy and readability on all devices. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Born into a life of bondage, Frederick Douglass secretly taught himself to read and write. It was a crime punishable by death, but it resulted in one of the most eloquent indictments of slavery ever recorded. His gripping narrative takes us into the fields, cabins, and manors of pre–Civil War plantations in the South and reveals the daily terrors he suffered. Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Written more than a century and a half ago by a Black man who went on to become a famous orator, U.S. minister to Haiti, and leader of his people, this timeless classic still speaks directly to our age. It is a record of savagery and inhumanity that goes far to explain why America still suffers from the great injustices of the past.

By focusing on a few individuals, Hersey brings home the lingering emotional and physical impact of first atomic bombing better than any subsequent writer on the subject. To this degree his work is an important literary contribution but hardly in the broader historical context. True, Hersey does not attempt to address the ethical issues surrounding Truman's decision to use the bomb and if the author's sole purpose was to intimately engage us with the personal dimensions of the aftermath, he should be lauded. Unfortunately, his work has been usurped by willfully ignorant liberals who are only too eager to assign this book to their dubiously historical archives. As another reviewer noted, no one seems to recall that in a two day period in mid-March, 1945 more civilians were killed in an incendiary raid on Tokyo-Yokohama than in the combined atomic bombings. The point here is not to quibble over casualty rates (human life is hardly a quibbling matter!) but to soberly pose the same question to ourselves that Truman and his advisers faced, namely, what made the bombings necessary? The most succinct response I have read to this question appears in the scholarly book &quot;Truman and the Hiroshima Cult.&quot; I highly recommend it to the genuinely interested and the liberally befuddled. Consider what another reviewer has said: the Japanese were not the victims in this war and Japanese civilians were culpable. As a conservative estimate, the Japanese would have inflicted over 100,000 casualties on American forces in the first month of the Kyushu invasion. Let's stop conveniently villifying Truman and our other government leaders for once and ponder what we would have done if faced with the same enormous decision. Perhaps then we will see Hersey's book in a different, less strident, light.",2020,en

Tolkien and the Great War: The Threshold of Middle-earth,"How the First World War influenced the author of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: “Very much the best book about J.R.R. Tolkien that has yet been written.” —A. N. Wilson As Europe plunged into World War I, J. R. R. Tolkien was a student at Oxford and part of a cohort of literary-minded friends who had wide-ranging conversations in their Tea Club and Barrovian Society. After finishing his degree, Tolkien experienced the horrors of the Great War as a signal officer in the Battle of the Somme, where two of those school friends died. All the while, he was hard at work on an original mythology that would become the basis of his literary masterpiece, the Lord of the Rings trilogy. In this biographical study, drawn in part from Tolkien’s personal wartime papers, John Garth traces the development of the author’s work during this critical period. He shows how the deaths of two comrades compelled Tolkien to pursue the dream they had shared, and argues that the young man used his imagination not to escape from reality—but to transform the cataclysm of his generation. While Tolkien’s contemporaries surrendered to disillusionment, he kept enchantment alive, reshaping an entire literary tradition into a form that resonates to this day. “Garth’s fine study should have a major audience among serious students of Tolkien.” —Publishers Weekly “A highly intelligent book . . . Garth displays impressive skills both as researcher and writer.” —Max Hastings, author of The Secret War “Somewhere, I think, Tolkien is nodding in appreciation.” —San Jose Mercury News “A labour of love in which journalist Garth combines a newsman’s nose for a good story with a scholar’s scrupulous attention to detail . . . Brilliantly argued.” —Daily Mail (UK) “Gripping from start to finish and offers important new insights.” —Library Journal “Insight into how a writer turned academia into art, how deeply friendship supports and wounds us, and how the death and disillusionment that characterized World War I inspired Tolkien’s lush saga.” —Detroit Free Press",['John Garth'],HMH,2013-06-11,['Biography & Autobiography'],0618574816,A1CKS3WWMF5HPR,17/18,4.0,1071273600,A scholarly study--- not for the casual fan.,"This considered study of Tolkien's wartime experiences fills a void that Humphrey Carpenter's biography (an excellant book) only hinted existed.

Sometimes we would stop and buy some eggs from a friendly old woman, Mrs. Newman. One day I saw some numbers on her arm and asked them what they were. She patted my shoulder and told me she had been a nurse in a prison during WWII and that all the people there got tattoos for identification. Several years later, after I had developed an interest in holocaust studies, I picked up 'In the Hell of Auschwitz' at the library and was astonished to realize it was written by the 'egg lady'. Unfortunately Mrs. Newman had passed away by this time so I was unable to ask her some of the questions I had, and still have.Why did a 'Death Camp' have a hospital for inmates? Why were inmates given weeks and sometimes months to recover? Why were so many living witnesses left behind to be 'liberated' by the Soviets? Maybe Mrs. Newman couldn't have answered these questions, but I know she would not have minded me asking- I would get a pat on the arm, not a slap on the face. She was a warm, wonderful person who was very open about her experience.There are also some remarkable pictures in this book that appear nowhere else in Holocaust literature- believe me I've read every book on the subject. How and where did she get them? One picture is labeled as 'an SS guard watches prisoners loading bodies for the crematorium'. If this picture is authentic, it would be the only such picture in existence- there are absolutely no pictures which show SS gaurds over-seeing the disposal (sonderkommando) prisoners at work. Why have I never seen this photo anywhere else? There is a photo of a pile of twisted, naked corpses supposedly awaiting cremation at Auschwitz, but in a corner of the picture, somebody has written in small but legible script: 'Dachau'. Why did Mrs. Newman include it in a book about Auschwitz?The book is at turns inspiring and blood-curdling but, as a Holocaust student, the main objects of interest are the half-dozen photos included. They are unique, disturbing and finally perplexing- where did she get them? I wish I could look into her warm, understanding eyes one more time and ask her these things.

Paddington stands up well to the test of the years. Stephen Fry did an absolutely amazing job with the reading. I can imagine no one who could have done it better. It was simply flawless. He is always amazing, but his talent truly shined here. Really, I simply cannot describe how wonderful he was! I fell in love with Paddington all over again!",2012,en
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics),"Not that Hemingway was correct, but he did write in 1935: ""All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn;” unless we are to interpret the adjective 'modern' as 'unadorned.' But Hemingway's remark somehow points to the importance of Mark Twain's breezy, fresh, and straight-forward style.Huckleberry Finn is a poor child whose only family is “Pap” —his abusive drunk father. Huck runs away, and meets Jim, a slave, who is also running away. So, here we have from the very beginning of the novel, two heavy topics: child abuse and slavery. Although Mark Twain has been criticized for his stereotypical presentation Jim, he —a white author— imbues Jim with much humanity in an era in which slaves were considered sub-human. Had any other writer dare do such a thing? Dis anyone else besides Jane Austen write about the slave trade? It took courage to deal with such themes. But Mark Twain also threw other ethical dilemmas into the fray: It is right to obey wrong laws? Should the individual suffer to preserve society?Hence the universal importance of the book.To do honor to the original version, my editorial corrections are minimal. The language —including the dialects— have been left untouched, as well as terms today deemed offensive.","['Mark Twain', 'Marciano Guerrero']",Createspace Independent Pub,2014-09-27,['Fiction'],0762405414,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,1/1,5.0,1150675200,The American novel,"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is considered by many to be the American novel; the work that most closely represents the America experience. What then makes this such a great book to read, and such an embodiment of America? Many things.First, this book addresses the issue of color racism thoroughly and subtly from multiple viewpoints. The latter includes the naive reluctant racist (Huck), the naive apathetic racist (Tom), those discriminated against (Jim), and of course the active, enthusiastic racists (most everyone else we meet in the book). Racism is examined from both the mental viewpoints; how individuals consider others of the same and different race, and from the social viewpoint; how individuals of different races interact in public and private. This emphasis on race points to the heart of American history; few other countries have struggled with skin color bias as long and as deeply as the US.The second major point examined in this book is slavery; an issue strongly related to the first. Slavery as existed in other countries was rarely as delineated along color lines as it was in the USA. And rarely was it defined as a feature of different skin colors. For example, slavery throughout Europe was used as a form of criminal punishment. Likewise, slavery in the Middle East was a side effect of military conquest of one group of people by another. Not so in America. Here it was an inherent feature of how two races dealt with each other.The third theme of this book that strongly embodies the American experience is the fractured / divided family. Walk through any neighborhood in China, India, Japan, Mexico, Egypt, Ireland or most any other country, and most of the children you encounter live with their parents, and most of the parents you meet live with their children. Unique among nations is America where many children do not live with both their biological parents. True now, this was true in the mid-1800s when this book's story takes place. Jim is searching for his family and Huck has left his. At the end of the book, they meet Tom, another boy who is not being raised by his parents. In fact, the two most stable families nuclear families encountered in this book are the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons.This leads of course to a fourth feature of this book that is reflective of America; the family feud. For a country where everyone has so much, both back then and now in the early 21st century; Americans seem to have problems with neighbors. Nowadays, everyone wants a house with big yards to maximize separation between them and their neighbors, and neighbors rat on each other to their homeowners assocation. Back then, they had feuds.The fifth topic dealt with in this book is the con. Unique to America is the role of the con artist in our history and culture. Consider Jim and Tammy Fay Baker, Robert Millikan and Charles Keating of modern times, and Ponzi of the early 1900s. In this book the reader encounters numerous cons and con artists. Huck himself cons Jim at the end of the book whereby he concocts a series of escape plans that puts Jim thru a series of ordeals, all for the naive amusement of Huck.Having read several versions of Twain's classic by different publishers; this reviewer has only praise for this version. The book itself is a great classic and worthy of anyones time and effort in reading it.",2014,en

I laughed out loud and stifled sobs throughout the book as we watch the four March girls - Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth - turn from young girls to young wives. As I read, I worried that that description sounded a bit boring although it really is an entertaining book. Then it dawned on me that, as each chapter is a small vignette from the progress of their lives, this is a lot like watching Little House on the Prairie. This would be an exceptional book to read to children and is quite enjoyable for women of all ages to read for themselves.It was a bit of a blow when reading the afterword to find that Louisa Alcott did not like the book. She had been pressured into writing it by her publisher and regarded it as ""moral pap for the young"", calling the first part ""The Pathetic Family"" and writing an alternative second part she called ""Happy Women"" in which the sisters flourished in professional careers in a community of spinsters. ""Good Wives"" obviously won out and I can't say that I am not happy about that.One thing the book and the afterword did do is awaken an interest in Louisa May Alcott herself. This might be a wonderful place to start on a women's study given the disparity between the work produced and the authors ideals.Whether you are interested in reading it for sheer enjoyment or as a ""jumping off point"" for broader studies, you will enjoy the book.

A pretty simple whodunnit plot on the surface, but throughout the seven chapters, this story sereves to humanize the characters in a way no other book has. The line between good and evil is blurred even more by the actions of the Justice Leauge in this book, and it sets the tone nicely for the new DCU. No other comic has ever left images this memorable engrained in my mind. The image of a soaking wet Ralph Dibney craddling his wife in his arms is absoloutely heartbreaking, and the shot of Batman holding Robin is equally as painful.All in all I can't give this book a higher recommendation.

As books are usually better than films I was elated to finally settle in and begin the journey. I will say that the book and movie are dramatically different in many respects and I love both for different reasons, but this novel surpasses the film in a great many of those respects.Just short of the new Millennium (1999), the Earth receives its first message from intelligent life in outer space. Ellie Arroway is the romantic, ambitious scientist at the center of Sagan's tale and her personal struggles and beliefs, as well as those of her colleagues, magnify the sentiments of the world around them. They are faced with meeting a new alien intelligence, new tests of faith, many of which they would've never expected within the realms of science, and they must come to terms with their new knowledge in order to make sense of an ever-changing world.How would a society react to such a realization of life beyond our planet, how would it affect the everyday lives of those involved, and how would it change the way science and religion function? All of these questions are addressed in Sagan's staggering, uplifting, poignant piece of fiction.Steeped in technical and scientific terms, the book is challenging, but incredibly fulfilling. I came away from the last page with a deep sense of satisfaction, awe, and a great regard for Sagan's method of bringing science to the masses. This book really makes you evaluate the harmony of science and faith and points out that the two, indeed, can work together.",2019,en

"Cashing In on a Second Home in Mexico: How to Buy, Rent and Profit from Property South of the Border","After nearly a decade of work in Mexico insuring real estate properties to foreign purchasers, the same issues always seem to surface regarding second home acquisitions: ""If I buy a house in Mexico, don't I get a 99-year lease from the government?"" ""I understand that I can buy a residence in Mexico only if the title is vested in a Mexican corporation."" ""I didn't think Americans could own Mexican beachfront properties."" All of these suppositions are incorrect. This book attempts to help clarify and explain why Mexican real estate, when using the proper safeguards, can be a terrific, secure investment. It will also explore the purchasing mistakes of the past, summarize several of the attractive new locations that are luring foreign dollars and explain why Mexico is so eager to welcome second home buyers from outside its borders. The worst thing a potential purchaser can do is to remain ignorant of the law and procedures involved in the conveyance of real estate in a foreign country. As we state several times in this book, Mexico is not the perceived ""Wild West"" where anything goes and the prevailing Mexican attitude is ""trust me, no problema."" It is inherently important for non-Mexican buyers to understand that Mexico has formality of law with authorized regulation of real estate development procedures at all levels. This process is coupled with a statutory government framework for the legal conveyance of real property. Great personal wealth has been attained through real estate ownership, but for most of us, it has been limited to investment in a primary residence. Although Mexican real estate also can be a viable investment venue, Americans have had a great deal more trepidation considering properties ""south of the border."" And for good reason--considering the history of some acquisitions. Given today's investment climate, however, Mexico provides an attractive, alternative arena for potential investment. Real estate in Mexico should have a similar appreciation ""upside"" as does real estate in a U.S. development--coupled with the advantage of use and enjoyment of the property as a vacation residence.",['Tom Kelly'],eBookIt.com,2014-10-10,['Business & Economics'],0977092003,A15H8RXNG3IHTN,17/18,5.0,1183593600,Great Book,"I ""bought"" a home in Puerto Pensaco two years ago.

The Gendered Cyborg: A Reader,"The Gendered Cyborg explores the relationship between representation, technoscience and gender, through the metaphor of the cyborg. The contributors argue that the figure of the cyborg offers ways of thinking about the relationship between culture and technology, people and machines which disrupt the power of science to enfore the categories through which we think about being human: male and female. Taking inspiration from Donna Haraway's groundbreaking Manifesto for Cyborgs, the articles consider how the cyborg has been used in cultural representation from reproductive technology to sci-fi, and question whether the cyborg is as powerful a symbol as is often claimed. The different sections of the reader explore: * the construction of gender categories through science * the interraction of technoscience and gender in contemporary science fiction film such as Bladerunner and the Alien series * debates around modern reproductive technology such as ultrasound scans and IVF, assessing their benefits and constraints for women * issues relating to artificial intelligence and the internet.","['Fiona Hovenden', 'Linda Janes', 'Gill Kirkup', 'Kathryn Woodward']",Routledge,2013-09-13,['Social Science'],0415220904,AUBHE1ZMN8CP6,0/0,4.0,1352851200,"ok for me, probably really great to others","i bought the reader for a class. really didnt end up being my cup of tea, but can see how it could be for others. if your into feminism and scifi this is the book for you. good essays well written by a variety of solid writers.",2013,en
Welcome to the Monkey House,"Since its original publication in 1968, Welcome to the Monkey House has been one of Kurt Vonnegut’s most beloved works. This special edition celebrates a true master of the short-story form by including multiple variant drafts of what would eventually be the title story. In a fascinating accompanying essay, “Building the Monkey House: At Kurt Vonnegut’s Writing Table,” noted Vonnegut scholar Gregory D. Sumner walks readers through Vonnegut’s process as the author struggles—false start after false start—to hit upon what would be one of his greatest stories. The result is the rare chance to watch a great writer hone his craft in real time. Includes the following stories: “Where I Live” “Harrison Bergeron” “Who Am I This Time?” “Welcome to the Monkey House” “Long Walk to Forever” “The Foster Portfolio” “Miss Temptation” “All the King’s Horses” “Tom Edison’s Shaggy Dog” “New Dictionary” “Next Door” “More Stately Mansions” “The Hyannis Port Story” “D.P.” “Report on the Barnhouse Effect” “The Euphio Question” “Go Back to Your Precious Wife and Son” “Deer in the Works” “The Lie” “Unready to Wear” “The Kid Nobody Could Handle” “The Manned Missiles” “Epicac” “Adam” “Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow”",['Kurt Vonnegut'],Dial Press Trade Paperback,2014-04-08,['Fiction'],B000GZZYZ0,A1MAHU7KURK0WX,0/0,5.0,1359158400,Good selection,Welcome to the Monkey House was the first Kurt Vonnegut story that I read.

King's novels...are in another solar system entirely.""--Bookpage, starred review The Shoveler, the Freak, CanIHelpYou?, Loretta the Flea-Circus Ring Mistress, and First-Class Malcolm. These are the five teenagers lost in the Hemmings family's maze of tangled secrets. Only a generation removed from being Pennsylvania potato farmers, Gottfried and Marla Hemmings managed to trade digging spuds for developing subdivisions and now sit atop a seven-figure bank account--wealth they've declined to pass on to their adult children or their teenage grandchildren. ""Because we want them to thrive,"" Marla always says. What does thriving look like? Like carrying a snow shovel everywhere. Like selling pot at the Arby's drive-thru window. Like a first-class ticket to Jamaica between cancer treatments. Like a flea-circus in a double-wide. Like the GPS coordinates to a mound of dirt in a New Jersey forest. As the rot just beneath the surface of the Hemmings' precious suburban respectability begins to spread, the far-flung grandchildren gradually find their ways back to one another, just in time to uncover the terrible cost of maintaining the family name. With her inimitable prose and keen insight into teenage experience, A.S.

The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering,"In his iconoclastic and controversial study, Norman G. Finkelstein moves from an interrogation of the place the Holocaust has come to occupy in global culture to a disturbing examination of recent Holocaust compensation settlements. It was not until the Arab–Israeli War of 1967, when Israel’s evident strength brought it into line with US foreign policy, that memory of the Holocaust began to acquire the exceptional prominence it has today. Recalling Holocaust fraudsters such as Jerzy Kosiński and Binjamin Wilkomirski, as well as the demagogic constructions of writers like Daniel Goldhagen, Finkelstein contends that the main danger posed to the memory of Nazism’s victims comes from some of the very people who profess most passionately to defend it. Drawing on a wealth of untapped sources, he exposes the double shakedown of European countries and legitimate Jewish claimants, and concludes that the Holocaust industry has become an outright extortion racket.",['Norman G.

Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library),"In a timely update of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, National Book Award finalist Ibi Zoboi skillfully balances cultural identity, class, and gentrification against the heady magic of first love in her vibrant reimagining of this beloved classic. A smart, funny, gorgeous retelling starring all characters of color. Zuri Benitez has pride. Brooklyn pride, family pride, and pride in her Afro-Latino roots. But pride might not be enough to save her rapidly gentrifying neighborhood from becoming unrecognizable. When the wealthy Darcy family moves in across the street, Zuri wants nothing to do with their two teenage sons, even as her older sister, Janae, starts to fall for the charming Ainsley. She especially can’t stand the judgmental and arrogant Darius. Yet as Zuri and Darius are forced to find common ground, their initial dislike shifts into an unexpected understanding. But with four wild sisters pulling her in different directions, cute boy Warren vying for her attention, and college applications hovering on the horizon, Zuri fights to find her place in Bushwick’s changing landscape, or lose it all. ""Zoboi skillfully depicts the vicissitudes of teenage relationships, and Zuri’s outsize pride and poetic sensibility make her a sympathetic teenager in a contemporary story about race, gentrification, and young love.""

I had previous knowledge of Jane Austen only as a giant of Western literature, but I resolved to read her work after seeing the delightful Emma Thompson movie Sense and Sensibility. I briefly entertained the notion of reading the novel Sense and Sensibility, but decided instead upon Pride and Prejudice. Mainly because Pride and Prejudice is widely considered to be the better book, but also because I wanted to read one of Austen's works that I had no previous familiarity with the characters and plot. I can happily say that this book has awakened within me a voracious beast of a reader who has every intent of devouring every Austen novel he can get his hands on. It is a testament to Austen's incredible prowess as a writer that she is able to breathe life into a historical period that 21st century readers are far removed from, and by the end of the book you have come to look upon Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Darcy, not as the heroine and hero of a book 200 years old, but as completely fleshed out characters who could exist in any time, in any novel. The reader comes to understand their joys, their pain, their defeats, and their ultimate triumph, as if these emotions were his own. The hallmark of all great literature is an ability to awaken in the reader a true sense of understanding for what the characters are thinking and feeling, and that is certainly the case in this wonderful book.",2018,en

His young men are uniformly intelligent (one might even say intellectually arrogant), intrepid, and high-spirited. They tend to actively seek adventure rather than waiting for adventure to stumble over them.Dick Cranston was playing hide-and-seek on a midnight beach with his lover, Lady Blair, when a naked man walked out of the sea. Shortly thereafter, someone starts shooting at him. Cranston makes a split second decision to help the man escape from his would-be-murderers. He doesn't know that his decision will involve him in a long, at times terrifying journey from the coast of Scotland to London. He soon learns that the man from the sea is a British nuclear physicist who had defected to the Soviet Union at the beginning of the Cold War, and who now has his own reasons for returning home.This Cold War melodrama has a bit of anti-communist rhetoric, although not nearly as much Evil Empire stuff as other mystery novelists who were writing at the same time, e.g. Rex Stout. Innes is more interested in the complex character of the man from the sea, who betrayed his country for what might seem like trivial reasons to us, and who might be planning to betray her again. We don't find out until the end of the book why the man from the sea returned to England.Meanwhile there's a rousing chase across the quarries, beaches, and heath of Scotland wherein Dick Cranston falls out of love twice and into love for a third and probably last time.Love, suspense, and the searing breath of danger envelope us as we follow Cranston and the man from the sea to their final, surprising destination.",2022,en

(This is incidentally, how ALL general versions of Shakespeare are edited-of course, Shakespeare's English is a lot closer to our own, but his work would still be much more difficult to read if you had to decipher the original spelling.) Of course, a few commonly used words and a greater number of rare words have not survived into modern English, and the reader needs to learn these; a list is provided. But that is much easier than having to also decipher virtually every word because its spelling is not recognizable.Naturally, pronunciation changes over time, as does spelling, so some of the rhythm and rhyme doesn't quite work. But it's more than passable, and in any case reconstructions of Middle English pronunciation are all hypothetical, with scholarly disagreements.There is nothing wrong with the Middle English editions for those with the time and inclination to tackle them.

A Life Worth Living,"Marsha Linehan tells the story of her journey from suicidal teenager to world-renowned developer of the life-saving behavioral therapy DBT, using her own struggle to develop life skills for others. “This book is a victory on both sides of the page.”—Gloria Steinem “Are you one of us?” a patient once asked Marsha Linehan, the world-renowned psychologist who developed Dialectical Behavior Therapy. “Because if you were, it would give all of us so much hope.” Over the years, DBT had saved the lives of countless people fighting depression and suicidal thoughts, but Linehan had never revealed that her pioneering work was inspired by her own desperate struggles as a young woman. Only when she received this question did she finally decide to tell her story. In this remarkable and inspiring memoir, Linehan describes how, when she was eighteen years old, she began an abrupt downward spiral from popular teenager to suicidal young woman. After several miserable years in a psychiatric institute, Linehan made a vow that if she could get out of emotional hell, she would try to find a way to help others get out of hell too, and to build a life worth living. She went on to put herself through night school and college, living at a YWCA and often scraping together spare change to buy food. She went on to get her PhD in psychology, specializing in behavior therapy. In the 1980s, she achieved a breakthrough when she developed Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, a therapeutic approach that combines acceptance of the self and ways to change. Linehan included mindfulness as a key component in therapy treatment, along with original and specific life-skill techniques. She says, ""You can't think yourself into new ways of acting; you can only act yourself into new ways of thinking."" Throughout her extraordinary scientific career, Marsha Linehan remained a woman of deep spirituality. Her powerful and moving story is one of faith and perseverance. Linehan shows, in Building a Life Worth Living, how the principles of DBT really work—and how, using her life skills and techniques, people can build lives worth living.",['Marsha M.

1984,"Nieuwspraak, Big Brother, het vocabulaire uit 1984 is in onze taal opgenomen en een eigen leven gaan leiden. De roman van George Orwell uit 1949 over de strijd van Winston Smith, ambtenaar op het ministerie van Waarheid, tegen de alles doordringende Partij, en zijn gedoemde liefde voor Julia heeft niets van zijn literarie zeggingskracht verloren. In Orwells steeds weer herdrukte anti-utopie verkeert de wereld in de wurggreep van een systeem dat is gegrondvest op de verbreiding van angst, haat en wreedheid, en dat iedere vorm van persoonlijke vrijheid en indiviualiteit uitsluit. 1984 is onverminderd geldig als benauwend nauwkeurig blauwdruk van elk dictatoriaal regime.",['George Orwell'],Singel Uitgeverijen,2013-05-16,['Fiction'],B000HVR6KY,AJ98YA4Y333BK,2/2,5.0,1275609600,The Great Novel of the 20th Century,"In terms of exploring the human condition in the modern era, this is the great novel of the twentieth century. I first read this book in 1968, when 1984 seemed far in the future. Now it's 26 years in the past. The totalitarian regime of the Soviet Union which so much concerned Orwell is also long gone. But the novel lives on for good reason.Orwell's book will be read for centuries -- when the totalitarian regimes of the 20th Century are as distant in the past as the 30 Years War is from us -- because Orwell is concerned about the nature of reality and the nature of power. Reality, after all, is a construct. We must strive to superimpose some narrative on the events and data swirling around us. This requires the use of language and the use of a context. Therefore, if one controls language and one controls the historical record that gives everything a context, one can control and manipulate everyone's reality. One can, in short, achieve absolute power.In the future dystopia imagined by Orwell the state controls language and constantly rewrites the past. Words are systmatically eliminated from the English language so that there are no longer any shades of gray. Absolute control over information is achieved so that however ridiculous the latest message from the party, it must be believed -- and if it is not believed, one begins to question one's own sanity.Much of debate surrounding this book centers around whether the precise dystopia predicted by Orwell will ever actually occur, thereby missing the point. Given the information revolution, the shrinking of the world, and the fall of the Soviet Union, we are less concerned today about the threat of a totalitarian regime than we are by resource limitations. The dystopia we now imagine concerns a constant state of war over shrinking resources complicated by the ability of small fringe groups to use terror as an effective weapon against highly centralized and complex modern structures.But Orwell's vision is more fundamental. Given the profound ability to manipulate and control the individual, what is to prevent humanity from ultimately degenerating over the next millenia into systems resembling the ant heap? For Orwell, the individual's duty is to be constantly vigilant about manipulations of language, ideas, and history that occur in every society so that we don't take any steps toward the world of the ant heap.This is an absolutely brilliant book, written with great passion in 1948 by a dying man concerned about the human condition. It is one of the few books that everyone must read.",2013,en

Pride & Prejudice (Classic Library),"In a timely update of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, National Book Award finalist Ibi Zoboi skillfully balances cultural identity, class, and gentrification against the heady magic of first love in her vibrant reimagining of this beloved classic. A smart, funny, gorgeous retelling starring all characters of color. Zuri Benitez has pride. Brooklyn pride, family pride, and pride in her Afro-Latino roots. But pride might not be enough to save her rapidly gentrifying neighborhood from becoming unrecognizable. When the wealthy Darcy family moves in across the street, Zuri wants nothing to do with their two teenage sons, even as her older sister, Janae, starts to fall for the charming Ainsley. She especially can’t stand the judgmental and arrogant Darius. Yet as Zuri and Darius are forced to find common ground, their initial dislike shifts into an unexpected understanding. But with four wild sisters pulling her in different directions, cute boy Warren vying for her attention, and college applications hovering on the horizon, Zuri fights to find her place in Bushwick’s changing landscape, or lose it all.

I first came upon it when inventorying my late father's estate, which contained a very old, thoroughly-thumbed and dog-eared copy dating to the first edition. (Dad was a veteran of the Pacific war). I could not put the book down. ""Zero!"" is a thoroughly honest, non-jingoistic view of the aerial component of the Pacific war from the Japanese perspective, beginning with ""The Sino-Japanese Incident"" (Japan's war of aggression against China) through the defeat of Japan by the United States. While not everything in the book is necessarily correct, I believe that most or all readers will agree that the authors were scrupulously honest in their writing, and they convey the facts of the war as they saw it.The title of the book, ""Zero"" reflects the authors' view that the design characteristics of the famed Zero fighter aircraft were central to Japan's waging of the Pacific war. As of 7 December 1941 the Zero could outfly, outdistance, and outfight any fighter that the United States had in service, and was rightly feared and respected by allied fighter pilots. So were the Japanese pilots themselves, who were largely battle-hardened veterans of tough aerial campaigns over China fought during the late 1930s. The Zero's range and other attributes were what made much of Japan's Pacific campaign possible, as the Zero had an unprecedented combat radius which the authors explain was central to Japan's strategy of establishing a tough perimeter for its aspiring empire.The book is fascinating. It fully explains how the earlier American fighters were outclassed by the Zero, how the P-38 Lockheed Lightning was the first viable answer by America to the Zero (it had wildly different flight characteristics which required both sides to modify their tactics), and how finally, by late 1943 newer American designs i.e. the Hellcat, Mustang, and Corsair, finally relegated the Zero to obsolescence even as America gained the upper hand.Other wonderful insights abound. Japan never gave its heros medals, not even to the great Japanese pilot/ace Saburo Sakai (a great chapter is devoted to him--see also the book ""Samurai"" and my review thereof)-- the authors' regret and perhaps resentment of this policy is plain. Japan was in awe of America's ability to hugely supply distant outposts shortly after launching an invasion--Japanese forces in the Pacific were always undersupplied and not only due to American action--the Japanese never really developed a modern logistical capability equal to the demands of global war. Similarly, the authors lament that Japan simply did not attach importance to such things as insect control and other dimensions of jungle hygiene for their outposts. This lowered the efficiency of the men markedly, as no doubt bureaucrats in Tokyo expected the men in distant jungles to overcome disease, hunger, and discomfort with warrior zeal. And yet, throughout all of this, the American reader will gain a respect for the determination, discipline and dedication of the Japanese foe of the time.I have never read a better book about the Pacific war.

Straightforward: How to Mobilize Heterosexual Support for Gay Rights,"What can straight people do to support gay rights? How much work or sacrifice must allies take on to do their share? Ian Ayres and Jennifer Brown--law professors, activists, husband and wife--propose practical strategies for helping straight men and women advocate for and with the gay community. Straightforward advances a thesis that is at once simple and groundbreaking: to make real progress at the central flashpoints of controversy--marriage rights, employment discrimination, gays in the military, exclusion from the Boy Scouts, and religious controversies over homosexuality--straight as well as gay people need to speak up and act for equality. Ayres and Brown take aim at both the hearts and minds of the general public, focusing on strategies that can change the incentives and therefore the behavior of the recalcitrant. The book is peppered with stories about real people and the decisions they have faced at home, in church, at work, in school, and in politics. It is also filled with creative legal and economic strategies for influencing public and corporate decision-making. For example, Ayres and Brown propose the development of a ""fair employment mark"" to help companies advertise inclusive employment policies. They also show how a simple pledge to vacation in states that legalize gay marriage can create powerful incentives for legislatures to amend their marriage laws.

Our guests who feel most comfortable here, and return year after year, are Gentiles."" So begins Natalie's fixation with the Inn and the family who owns it. And when Natalie finagles an invitation to join a friend on vacation there, she sets herself upon a path that will inextricably link her adult life into this peculiar family and their once-restricted hotel. The Inn at Lake Devine will enchant readers with the beguiling voice, elegant charm, and deft storytelling that have been hallmarks of Elinor Lipman's previous novels and have made her beloved by her fans. Her characters sparkle on the page and delight us with their wit and grace--even when anti-Semitism rears its head in Vermont and the tables are turned in the Catskills.

Atlantis Found,"Clive Cussler sends his great hero on an explosive mission in Atlantis Found, the fifteenth Dirk Pitt adventure. Around the world ancient artefacts are suddenly appearing, hinting at a catastrophe that will soon visit Earth ... Dirk Pitt is on hand at a Colorado archaeological site where an ancient and mysterious artefact has been found - one that is perhaps linked to other strange objects turning up across the globe. And soon Pitt's skills and ingenuity are desperately needed to rescue the team after a suspicious explosion seals them deep underground. It quickly becomes clear that the artefacts carry a message: warning of global Armageddon. Yet a shadowy organisation called the Fourth Empire not only wants to stop others from heeding that warning, but is also actively seeking to accelerate the end it foretells. Now Pitt and NUMA must face this diabolical foe, who will stop at nothing to wipe out all life on earth ... Packed with blistering action and hair-raising suspense, Atlantis Found is Clive Cussler at his brilliant best. Atlantis Found is the fifteenth of Clive Cussler's bestselling Dirk Pitt thrillers - the series that also includes Arctic Drift and, his first novel, Mayday - in which the discovery of an artefact could mean the end of the world.

He first meets Carmen, the younger daughter who is a few cards short of a full deck. The General stays in his hothouse, looking like a near corpse. He tells Marlow about Rusty Regan, the older daughter's third husband, who suddenly disappeared last month. The real job is the gambling debts of Carmen. Before leaving, Marlowe meets Vivian, the spoiled and ruthless older daughter, who asks about his assignment. Chandler painted a picture of a powerful and corrupt family whose wealth far exceeds their judgment. Marlow represents the real people who must follow the whims of the ruling elite. Chandler used many words to describe the surroundings and background, more literary than Hammett or Gardner.Marlowe began to investigate the man who had Carmen's gambling chits. Geiger's store rents ""rare books"". Marlowe followed Geiger to his house, then waited and watched. When he heard shots Marlowe broke in. Carmen was seated, nude with pin-point pupils. Geiger lay dead on the floor. Marlowe rescued Carmen and drove back in her Packard. Marlowe walked back to Geiger's house (not taxi driver with a memory for him). He found Geiger's body has disappeared! Next the Sternwood's chauffeur is found dead in a car that went into the ocean; was it murder? Marlowe shadows Geiger's store again, and learns more. The journey towards the truth continues.Who killed Geiger? And Taylor the chauffeur? Gathering the facts allows the solution of the puzzle. Chapter 19 tells how the newspapers covered the stories. Chapter 25 has the news on a missing couple that Marlowe isn't looking for. Marlowe drives to this small town, locates the isolated house, and finds danger (Chapter 27). Marlowe explains his actions to General Sternwood, and gets another assignment (Chapter 30). The surprise ending occurs in Chapter 31. Little hints had been sprinkled throughout the book, but a reader would not pick them up. We see what we expect to see in most cases. The final chapter has the solution to Regan's disappearance. Marlowe orders the solution to the remaining problems and leaves, trusting his advice will be taken.The moral of this story reminds me of ""Love Story"" where someone poor falls in love with someone rich, and the poor person comes to a bad end. As Owen Taylor did. Do the rich get away with murder, literally? Do the wealthy spend their time with drink, drugs, gambling, sex, and other thrills? Would higher taxes on estates and trusts prevent this problem? Note how the super rich use the underworld to solve problems that can't be delegated to lawyers.For a faster paced style of murder mystery, read Erle Stanley Gardner.",2013,en
Sacrifice,"The shocking and affecting memoir from a gold-star widow searching for the truth behind her Green Beret husband's death, this book bears witness to the true sacrifices made by military families. When Green Beret Bryan Black was killed in an ambush in Niger in 2017, his wife Michelle saw her worst nightmare become a reality. She was left alone with her grief and with two young sons to raise. But what followed Bryan's death was an even more difficult journey for the young widow. After receiving very few details about the attack that took her husband's life, it was up to Michelle to find answers. It became her mission to learn the truth about that day in Niger--and Sacrifice is the result of that mission. In this heartbreaking and revelatory memoir, Michelle uses exclusive interviews with the survivors of her husband's unit, research into the military leadership and accountability, and her own unique vantage point as a gold-star widow to tell a previously unknown story. Sacrifice is both an honest, emotional look inside a military marriage and a searing investigation of the people and decisions at the heart of the US military.",['Michelle Black'],Penguin,2022-05-10,['Biography & Autobiography'],0066212375,A2F6N60Z96CAJI,0/1,4.0,1059177600,The Candiotti series just keeps getting better and better,"San Francisco is the type of city that makes for a natural setting for a murder mystery. The fog-shrouded buildings, the rolling streets, and the marked diversity of its citizens seem to have been created expressly for mystery, intrigue, and suspense. Writers from Dashiell Hammett to Robert B. Parker to D.W. Buffa have used San Francisco either during part of or the entirety of one or more novels, and to wonderful effect.SACRIFICE is the third of Clyde Phillips's novels to feature San Francisco Police Inspector Jane Candiotti. SACRIFICE is a study in contrast: it begins with the murder of Philip Iverson, a man wealthy almost beyond imagining, on the most gratifying night of his life. It is followed closely by the murder of Willie Temple, a man whose life has been on a downward spiral for decades. Candiotti's homicide team --- a team that includes her husband, detective Kenny Marks --- is assigned to both homicides. Iverson's murder is given the expected priority, yet Candiotti, despite pressure from the mayor on down, refuses to simply neglect Temple's murder, even when there is subtle pressure to do so. As the murders of both of these very different men are investigated, it is slowly but painstakingly determined that neither their lives nor their deaths are quite what they seemed to be.Candiotti's team, through good, old-fashioned police work, also discovers the tenuous, random connection between the men that resulted in the death of one of them, a discovery that places Candiotti in life-threatening danger from two wholly unexpected sources. Phillips plays the story out against the stark backdrop of a city that suffers from a slow internal decay, while nonetheless maintaining an external beauty and keeping the reader on a roller coaster ride of suspense. Phillips also continues to develop the characters, and relationship, of Candiotti and Marks. Their professional and personal relationships do not always mesh well --- Nick and Nora, they're not --- but Phillips infuses them with a willingness to make things work that is at once refreshing and realistic.SACRIFICE continues the tradition that began with FALL FROM GRACE and BLINDSIDED, while furthering the development and evolution of Candiotti and Marks. Phillips's ability and inclination to keep his characters fresh and yet familiar bodes well for future volumes of this series --- and for Phillips's growing number of readers.

Moby Dick or the White Whale,"Moby Dick is a novel by American writer Herman Melville. The work is an epic sea story of Captain Ahab's voyage in pursuit of Moby Dick, a great white whale. A contemporary commercial failure and out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891, its reputation rose during the twentieth century. D.H. Lawrence called it ""the greatest book of the sea ever written."" Jorge Luis Borges praised the style: ""Unforgettable phrases abound."" Today it is considered one of the Great American Novels and a leading work of American Romanticism. The opening line, ""Call me Ishmael,"" is one of the most recognizable opening lines in Western literature. Ishmael then narrates the voyage of the whaleship Pequod, commanded by Captain Ahab. Ahab has one purpose: revenge on Moby Dick, a ferocious, enigmatic white whale which on a previous voyage destroyed Ahab's ship and severed his leg at the knee. The detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and the process of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of God. Melville uses a wide range of styles and literary devices ranging from lists and catalogs to Shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies, and asides.",['Herman Melville'],BookRix,2022-02-01,['Fiction'],B000NPQOMA,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,1/4,3.0,1147910400,A whale of a book,"Moby Dick is one of those classic books that is actually several simultaneous books rolled up into one; each a level below the other. At the most superficial level, Moby Dick is an adventure - drama about a male albino sperm while of the same name that roams the open oceans while being chased by a crew of whalers on a sailing ship named the Pequod. The ship is captained by Ahab, a man who has lost one leg in a previous encounter with the great whale. The book progresses thru various chapters. The initial and final chapters are the story itself; the chase of the whale across the oceans. The middle chapters provide a thorough and detailed examination of various facets of whales, sailing and the whaling industry.If this book was only an adventure story on the high seas; it would probably be unknown today for it is long and quite boring with a lot of pages devoted to dialogue and description. But, at a deeper level this book is a careful study of the vast range of human emotions. The terror of the sailors facing the great whale, the agony felt by survivors of crashed boats, the vengeance that drives Ahab, the comraderie between members of the harpooning team, the rivalries between the different harpooners, the suspense of the lookouts trying to get the first glimpse of whale or land... the vast range of emotions that man can experience are experienced on the Pequoud's journey. Key to this study is the fact that the ship's crew forms Western literature's first, truly multi-racial cast of characters. Names like Queequeg, Ishmael, Starbuck, Tashtego, and Daggoo represent the various races known to white man during the time of this book's writing.At the most basic level, this book, like all other classics in the western genre, is a commentary of human society. Here, the theme is mankind's destructive behavior, its attempts to control nature, and the ensuing wreckage that nature can bring forth onto man. Interestingly enough, the two leaders of the great quest are Ahab, an American, and Flask, an Englishman. At the time of the book's writing, America and England were in the throes of the Industrial Revolution. A visitor to the cities of either country at that time would be repulsed by the smokestacks, pollution, dirty streets, and factories. Both countries were undergoing large-scale transitions from societies that lived with nature to those that destroyed nature. The four harpooners are from native tribes in various parts of the world. As harpooners, they are the ones who will kill the whales. As an allegory, the represent the fact that in many lands, it was the natives who first showed the encroaching white man how to feed of nature's bounty. Ishael of course is Jewish. And it is the sole Jew on the boat who survives the onslaught of Moby Dick. This parallels the Bible, where the Jews are those chosen by God.I read this book when I was in my late teens and found it quite challenging. I only finished it with the help of reading aides and study guides. I would not recommend attempting to read this unaided, for it can be quite boring and challenging.",2022,en
Lord of the Flies,"William Golding’s unforgettable classic of boyhood adventure and the savagery of humanity comes to Penguin Classics in a stunning Graphic Deluxe Edition with a new foreword by Lois Lowry As provocative today as when it was first published in 1954, Lord of the Flies continues to ignite passionate debate with its startling, brutal portrait of human nature. William Golding’s compelling story about a group of very ordinary boys marooned on a coral island has been labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, and even a vision of the apocalypse.

The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,"A good book may have the power to change the way we see the world, but a great book actually becomes part of our daily consciousness, pervading our thinking to the point that we take it for granted, and we forget how provocative and challenging its ideas once were—and still are. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is that kind of book. When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. Fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach. With The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don’t arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation but that the revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of “normal science,” as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age. This new edition of Kuhn’s essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introduction by Ian Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn’s ideas to the science of today.

The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Penguin Classics),"This book explores Bernard Shaw’s journalism from the mid-1880s through the Great War—a period in which Shaw contributed some of the most powerful and socially relevant journalism the western world has experienced. In approaching Shaw’s journalism, the promoter and abuser of the New Journalism, W. T. Stead, is contrasted to Shaw, as Shaw countered the sensational news copy Stead and his disciples generated. To understand Shaw’s brand of New Journalism, his responses to the popular press’ portrayals of high profile historical crises are examined, while other examples prompting Shaw’s journalism over the period are cited for depth: the 1888 Whitechapel murders, the 1890-91 O’Shea divorce scandal that fell Charles Stewart Parnell, peace crusades within militarism, the catastrophic Titanic sinking, and the Great War. Through Shaw’s journalism that undermined the popular press’ shock efforts that prevented rational thought, Shaw endeavored to promote clear thinking through the immediacy of his critical journalism. Arguably, Shaw saved the free press.","[""Nelson O'Ceallaigh Ritschel""]",Springer,2017-02-07,['Performing Arts'],0613642910,A2ILV2Q0C6TN9P,0/0,5.0,1361404800,Short and entertaining,"I always liked the story and often think plays should be watched, not read.

Dynah Carey knew where her life was headed. Engaged to a wonderful man, the daughter of doting parents, a faithful child of God—she has it all. Then the unthinkable happens: Dynah’s perfect life is irrevocably changed by a rape that results in an unwanted pregnancy.

I think that one of the English classes in my high school was reading ""My Antonia,"" while my class was being introduced to ""Tale of Two Cities."" So, reading her novel ""The Professor's House"" was a new experience for me, and I'm sorry it took me so many years before I discovered this truly wonderful writer.Cather writes about the America she knows, the Midwest. The protagonist in ""The Professor's House,"" which is set in 1920 in the Midwest, is a totally admirable American who is a model of virtue and traditional American values. But, as he reaches age 52, he experiences a very modern mid-life crisis and questions the value of his life, finding a lack of meaning in what he has become. In modern psycho-babble, we would say he's depressed. Although the plot has several interesting subplots, how the professor resolves his existential angst is the central theme of the book. Cather's prose is straight forward and, in its simplicity, elegant. The middle third of the book involves the exploration and exploitation of Indian ruins in New Mexico, and it describes areas with which I'm familiar and love. This aspect of the book was a very pleasant surprise.""The Professor's House"" is an easy book to read, is very enjoyable and meaningful, and demonstrates that good literature can illuminate and explain life. It is a rare combination of being a good story, and, providing the reader with a lot to ponder, if the reader chooses to go down that path with Willa Cather as the guide. Highly recommended.",2021,en

A smart, funny, gorgeous retelling starring all characters of color. Zuri Benitez has pride. Brooklyn pride, family pride, and pride in her Afro-Latino roots. But pride might not be enough to save her rapidly gentrifying neighborhood from becoming unrecognizable. When the wealthy Darcy family moves in across the street, Zuri wants nothing to do with their two teenage sons, even as her older sister, Janae, starts to fall for the charming Ainsley. She especially can’t stand the judgmental and arrogant Darius. Yet as Zuri and Darius are forced to find common ground, their initial dislike shifts into an unexpected understanding. But with four wild sisters pulling her in different directions, cute boy Warren vying for her attention, and college applications hovering on the horizon, Zuri fights to find her place in Bushwick’s changing landscape, or lose it all.

HYACINTH’S STORY Meet Our Hero . . . Gareth St. Clair is in a bind. His father, who detests him, is determined to beggar the St. Clair estates and ruin his inheritance. Gareth’s sole bequest is an old family diary, which may or may not contain the secrets of his past . . . and the key to his future.

But rest assured, he’s spinning in his grave when Gareth and Hyacinth cross paths at the annual—and annually discordant—Smythe-Smith musicale.

The Trolley to Yesterday,"A “spooky[,] spine-tingling” time travel adventure that takes a boy and his eccentric professor friend to the mysterious Byzantine Empire (Publishers Weekly) . . . [Description] Johnny Dixon is worried about Professor Childermass. The professor has always been an odd duck, but lately his behavior has been positively bizarre. He’s been talking to himself and stalking down the street with his collar turned up and his hat over his eyes, and now he won’t return Johnny’s calls. Johnny’s afraid that the professor’s old age is starting to get to him, but he will soon find it’s something far more amazing—and far more dangerous. The professor has discovered a trolley that can carry them five hundred years back in time, to the last days of the Byzantine Empire. In the dark and winding streets of Constantinople, he and Johnny confront crusaders, mystics, and thieves as they attempt to save the ancient empire from destruction at the hands of the advancing Turkish armies. Created by the award-winning author of The House with a Clock in Its Walls, Johnny Dixon is one of the most charming young heroes in literature—a spunky, bespectacled young man whose curiosity often gets him into trouble—and his “wonderfully warming friendship with cantankerous old Professor Childermass makes them an endearing detective team” (The New York Times).",['John Bellairs'],Open Road Media,2014-04-01,['Young Adult Fiction'],B000Q443VM,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,4/4,4.0,1049673600,Back through time,"Time travel in fantasy is now such a cliche that it's a bit hard to write anything original about it. But John Bellairs managed. ""Trolley to Yesterday"" has a bunch of intriguing twists and unexpected events -- and while it doesn't have as much supernatural content or scary bits, it still is an enjoyable read.Professor Childermass is acting even more oddly than usual, which is saying something. When Fergie and Johnny try to investigate his weird behavior (including sand on his carpet and talking to himself), they find the professor having a conversation with Brewster, a magical Egyptian statue. He admits his secret: Behind a bricked-up wall is a time-travelling trolley. And the boys hitch a ride when Childermass travels back in time to save the city of Constantinople from invasion.The problem? They arrive a little too late, and the city is being overrun by Turkish soldiers. As they struggle to make their way back to the trolley and the safety of the future, they encounter the trolley's creator (who accidently got left behind during one of its previous excursions), a deranged monk, and a group of ghostly Crusaders. But then Johnny is poisoned, and the only cure means going back to Constantinople -- and back into danger.Usually time travel books are full of cliches, and this one has a few, but you probably won't notice them. Kids who read this book may become interested in the Byzantine Empire -- while Bellairs doesn't present huge amounts of historical detail, he gives enough to be very, very interesting. (There's also a dash of Egyptian stuff too) There's adventure, humor and the odd way of getting around.Johnny and Fergie remain the surprisingly courageous duo of previous books, the shy boy and his brasher, jokier pal. Professor Childermass is crusty, sometimes a bit irrational, but very lovable. And Brewster (a deity of Upper and Lower Egypt) really steals the show with his dry little comments. .This book proably has one of the lowest amounts of supernatural stuff of Bellairs' books. Certainly it doesn't have much in the way of horror. But there is a great twist about halfway through, where our heroes are aided by a group of ghostly Crusaders, who are trying to make amends for sacking the city centuries before. I suppose Brewster technically counts as supernatural, and he provides a lot of the humor (such as translating a Turkish soldier's words as ""Butter and eggs, and a pound of cheese!"").""Trolley To Yesterday"" isn't Bellairs' best novel, but it is an intriguing and informative historical book that adults may enjoy as well, especially if they're Byzantine buffs. Good fun.",2014,en
Hitts & Mrs.,"""Success in dealing with unknown ciphers is measured by these four things in the order named: perseverance, careful methods of analysis, intuition, luck."" So begins the first chapter of Colonel Parker Hitt's 1916 Manual for the Solution of Military Ciphers, a foundational text in the history of cryptology. An irrepressible innovator, Hitt possessed those qualities in abundance. His manual, cipher devices, and proactive mentorship of Army cryptology during World War I laid the groundwork for the modern American cryptologic system. Though he considered himself an infantryman, Hitt is best known as the ""father of American military cryptology."" In Parker Hitt: The Father of American Military Cryptology, Betsy Rohaly Smoot brings Hitt's legacy to life, chronicling his upbringing, multiple careers, ingenious mind, and independent spirit. In the 1910s, after a decade as an infantry officer, Hitt set his sights on aviation. Instead, he was drawn to the applied sciences, designing signal and machine-gun equipment while applying math to combat problems. Atypical for the time, Hitt championed women in the workplace. During World War I he suggested the Army employ American female telephone operators, while his wife, Genevieve Young Hitt, became the first woman to break ciphers for the United States government. His daughter, Mary Lue Hitt, carried on the family legacy as a ""code girl"" during World War II. Readers of Elizabeth Cobb's The Hello Girls, Liza Mundy's Code Girls, and David Kahn's The Codebreakers will find in Parker Hitt's story an insightful profile of an American cryptologic hero and the early twentieth-century military. Drawing from a never-before-seen cache of Hitt's letters, photographs, and diaries, Smoot introduces readers to Hitt's life on the front lines, in classrooms and workshops, and at home.",['Betsy Rohaly Smoot'],University Press of Kentucky,2022-03-22,['Biography & Autobiography'],0060540591,A19J5M011PN34D,2/2,3.0,1098489600,One big miss . . .,"Appropriately labeled as ""chick lit,"" Lori Bryant-Woolridge's Hitts & Mrs. is a suspenseful romance of sorts spread out over nearly 400 pages of a grainy plot and inconsistencies. This is a topsy turvy story of Melanie Hitts coming to realize that love doesn't have to suffocate her budding career. Of course, the story wouldn't be complete without Melanie juggling two love interests; the man she is in love with and thinks is her soul-mate, Will Freedman, and the unconventional older man of a different hue whom teaches her how to love, John Carlson. John is married to Sharon Carlson, which makes for a tense situation in the book. Will Melanie and John get caught in their non-physical, but intimate affair? This question alone is what may keep readers struggling to the end of the book.The true suspense and drama of the plot lies in Candace Bennett, Melanie's best friend and wild child/vixen of the novel. Woolridge's scenes depicting Candace's 'love scenes' with various men are Zane worthy when it comes to how graphic they are. Candace's rags to riches transformation to a hot shot lawyer are also intriguing when it ties into her views on relationships.The main thing that kept me frustrated with this book was how Woolridge left things hanging when it came to Candace. The story of Melanie ultimately ""coming to her senses"" concerning her love of Will appeared to be stretched out with meaningless filler of the daily grind of Melanie's career as though Woolridge were trying to make a page quota. I'm not a lover of romance novels which may play a role in my feelings toward this story, but if you're a reader who loves tales of ""enchanted love"" with a little character development thrown in, you just might find yourself enjoying this book more than I did.AnnaR.E.A.L.

Raised in Depression-era Rockaway Beach, physicist Richard Feynman was irreverent, eccentric, and childishly enthusiastic—a new kind of scientist in a field that was in its infancy. His quick mastery of quantum mechanics earned him a place at Los Alamos working on the Manhattan Project under J.

Fortune is, as I said, a character, and H. C. Bailey doesn't let you forget it. Not for a paragraph. The author spends a quart (at least) of ink in dialog and description to show us what an uncommon creature his Reggie Fortune is: so clever, so cynical. As a result the detective ends up eclipsing the plot--to the ruination of the story. It's as if Bailey is inventing murders just to show you how clever his Reggie is in solving them. I am reminded of the bumper sticker: My child is an honor student...Now, Nero Wolfe is an engaging and credible character, and so (in his own prissy way) is Philo Vance. But, no literary creation should be as self-absorbed as Reggie Fortune is. It makes him seem overtly fictional, made up. The author is waving him in your face: See what I invented!Fortune is a physician by profession, yet his specialization only plays a minor role in his investigations.

Code of the Woosters,The superior valet Jeeves helps extricate Bertie Wooster from the many undignified situations in which he finds himself thanks to his bumbling escapades and zany adventures.,['Pelham Grenville Wodehouse'],Arrow,2018-06-28,['England'],0891902910,A1K1JW1C5CUSUZ,9/10,5.0,976233600,&quot;Never Let a Pal Down&quot;,"All of the P.G. Wodehouse novels about Bertram (&quot;Bertie&quot;) Wooster and his gentleman's gentleman, Jeeves, are funny. Some are reasonably complicated in their plots. But none compare to this classic in the series.From the beginning, Bertie is up against impossible odds. Sent by his Aunt Dahlia to sneer at a Cow Creamer, Bertie dangerously bumps into Sir Watkyn Bassett, the magistrate who once fined him five guineas for copping a policeman's helmet on Boat Race night, and Roderick Spode, Britain's aspiring fascist dictator. The only trouble in this encounter is that Bertie is clutching the Cow Creamer on the sidewalk after having tripped on a cat and falling through the front door, and Sir Watkyn recognizes him as a former criminal. Barely escaping arrest on the spot, Bertie returns home to find that Aunt Dahlia wants him to debark immediately for Totley Towers where Sir Watkyn has just taken the Cow Creamer he has purchased after pulling a ruse on Uncle Tom. When there, Bertie is to steal the Cow Creamer. At the same time, he receives urgent telegrams from his old pal, Gussie Fink-Nottle, to come to Totley Towers to save his engagement to Madeleine Bassett. Bertie feels like he is being sent into the jaws of death.Jeeves immediately fetches up a plot to get Madeleine Bassett, to whom he has been affianced twice, to invite Bertie to her father's home. Upon arriving, Sir Watkyn and Roderick Spode immediately catch him holding the Cow Creamer. Sir Watkyn threatens years in jail, until Madeleine comes in to rescue him. But Sir Watkyn proceeds to assume that everything that goes wrong from then is due to Bertie. For once, Bertie is the innocent party. But he takes the rap anyway, because of the code of the Woosters, never let a pal down.Never has anyone had a goofier set of pals. Gussie Fink-Nottle has developed spiritually so that he has less fear, but his method of achieving this soon puts him in peril. Stephanie &quot;Stiffy&quot; Byng, Sir Watkyn's niece, has to be the goofiest acquaintance that Bertie has. She is a one-woman wrecking machine for creating havoc. Her fiance, another old pal of Bertie's, &quot;Stinker&quot; Pinker, the local curate, is only slightly better.Just when you cannot see any way that Bertie can avoid gaol, Jeeves comes up with one brilliant plan after another. It's truly awe-inspiring as well as side-splittingly funny.P.G. Wodehouse remarked that he preferred to write as though the subject were musical comedy, and he has certainly captured that mood here at its vibrant best. You'll be on the edge of your chair and trying to avoid falling on the floor laughing at the same time.After you've followed more twists and turns than existed in the Labyrinth at Crete, consider how far you would go to save a pal . . . or to keep a secret . . . or to protect a loved one. What should the personal code be?Be generous with your friends and to all humankind.",2018,en

I suspect that you all whom have been reading the reviews and the excerpts understand the premise of the book.I feel that considering the fact that Savannah herself is Carpathian and was raised as a Carpathian princess for goodness sakes, she should not be behaving in such a mindless way. She has to understand what her fate is because that is all she has seen or known since the day she was born. Sooooo even with being young and immature, its kind of a stretch to see her put such demands on the man that she knows is her lifemate.I also dont think that it is ever ok to pass off rape as anything but rape. However,, considering the nature of the beings involved, I can sort of understand the violence in Gregori. If a being is almost wholly without light and prone to violent tendancies , as is the final state of Gregori, he may initially only have darkness to offer Savannah. After all, that is why he needs to mate with her in the first place.Still it would have been nice, had Savannah been able to detect this situation prior to Gregori losing control and used her ""light"" to put his darkness under subjection.Get the book, read it, judge for yourselveshappy reading!!!!!!Bottom line,, I still liked the book and found it worth reading.",2017,en

Old Man & the Sea,"From the New York Times–bestselling author of Poison Flower: a retired intelligence officer is caught in “[a] harrowing hunt-and-hide adventure” (The New York Times). To all appearances, Dan Chase is a harmless retiree in Vermont with two big mutts and a grown daughter he keeps in touch with by phone. But most sixty-year-old widowers don’t have multiple driver’s licenses, savings stockpiled in banks across the country, or two Beretta Nanos stashed in the spare bedroom closet. Most have not spent decades on the run. Thirty-five years ago, as a young army intelligence hotshot, Chase was sent to Libya to covertly assist a rebel army. When the plan turned sour, Chase acted according to his conscience—and triggered consequences he never could have anticipated. To this day, someone still wants him dead. And just when he thought he was finally safe, Chase is confronted with the history he spent much of his life trying to escape. “Perry drives deep into Jack Reacher territory in this stand-alone [novel] . . .

"Lord Jim,: A tale (The works of Joseph Conrad. The uniform ed)","Writing near the peak of the British Empire, Conrad drew on the national experiences of his native Poland—during nearly all his life, parceled out among three occupying empires—and on his own experiences in the French and British merchant navies, to create short stories and novels that reflect aspects of a European-dominated world—including imperialism and colonialism—and that profoundly explore the human psyche. Conrad is considered a literary impressionist by some and an early modernist by others, though his works also contain elements of 19th-century realism. His narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced numerous authors. Many dramatic films have been adapted from and inspired by his works. Numerous writers and critics have commented that his fictional works, written largely in the first two decades of the 20th century, seem to have anticipated later world events.

What makes this story extraordinary is the difficulty the reader has assessing the nature of the original act and then judging whether Jim has been punished enough. Joseph Conrad does not make it easy to gauge accurately either the man or his act since we can see the act filtered only through the lens of a narrator who is too close to the case to be judged reliable.LORD JIM is a novel of adventure and many read it on that basis, but lurking beneath the surface of a simple act is, as in so much of Conrad's fiction, a bewildering complexity of issues that tap into the deepest recesses of why people do what they do and how others can fairly judge them. Marlow is the narrator who attends the trial of a crewman Jim accused of abandoning his ship during a storm when he thought it was sinking. When all the ship's officers leap into a lifeboat they abandon the more than eight hundred passengers below decks. Jim joins them, and all are later picked up by a French trawler only to learn that their ship did not sink and in fact was safely towed to port. All the officers, except Jim, escape punishment either by running away or pleading illness. Only Jim decides to speak out publicly in his defense, but of course there is none, so he is found guilty and stripped of his seaman's certificate as punishment. Marlow sees the trial and decides to follow Jim around the world to get the truth. These are the bald facts, but what Conrad does with them is to invest them with emotional and psychological issues that resist easy analysis.To begin with, Conrad emphasizes Jim's ordinary state of being, by repeating that Jim is ""one of us."" This statement occurs so often that it becomes a mantra, inviting speculation as to what sense he is one of us. Whoever the ""us"" is, Conrad implies that the ""us"" must have had a standard of justice in which one size fits all. No one at the board of inquiry seems particularly upset that Jim was merely following the captain's orders to abandon ship nor that his record was otherwise flawless. The board judged Jim by an inflexible code of honor and found him wanting. Conrad, in his description of Jim as a maritime Everyman (no first name, a flat character who no past, present, and now no future), makes it easy to condemn the board's overhasty verdict to condemn Jim for an act that had mitigating circumstances. As Marlow gets to know Jim, he acknowledges that the more he knows, the less he understands. Conrad sets up a straw man in Jim. Because so many people, including Marlow, hold Jim under so many lenses, the images that result are often contradictory. The only constant is Jim himself. During the trial, and later during the climactic encounter with the natives who call him Lord Jim, Jim continues to attempt to see himself in the simplest manner possible. He knows that he cannot possibly be all the Jims floating on everyone's lips, so he determines to be the Jim who should have stayed on board the deck of a sinking ship. This Jim is willing to take responsibility for his actions. When he unwisely allows the dastardly Gentleman Brown to escape his richly deserved fate, he makes a colossal leap of faith: he will pay now for all sins of his past. In his death, Conrad suggests that this leap of faith may be the only trait that distinguishes reprobates like Brown from ordinary men like Jim who may not be so ordinary after all.",2022,en

Reason and emotion,"This book brings together twenty-three distinctive and influential essays on ancient moral philosophy--including several published here for the first time--by the distinguished philosopher and classical scholar John Cooper. The volume gives a systematic account of many of the most important issues and texts in ancient moral psychology and ethical theory, providing a unified and illuminating way of reflecting on the fields as they developed from Socrates and Plato through Aristotle to Epicurus and the Stoic philosophers Chrysippus and Posidonius, and beyond. For the ancient philosophers, Cooper shows here, morality was ""good character"" and what that entailed: good judgment, sensitivity, openness, reflectiveness, and a secure and correct sense of who one was and how one stood in relation to others and the surrounding world. Ethical theory was about the best way to be rather than any principles for what to do in particular circumstances or in relation to recurrent temptations. Moral psychology was the study of the psychological conditions required for good character--the sorts of desires, the attitudes to self and others, the states of mind and feeling, the kinds of knowledge and insight. Together these papers illustrate brilliantly how, by studying the arguments of the Greek philosophers in their diverse theories about the best human life and its psychological underpinnings, we can expand our own moral understanding and imagination and enrich our own moral thought. The collection will be crucial reading for anyone interested in classical philosophy and what it can contribute to reflection on contemporary questions about ethics and human life.",['John M.

It never fails to move me and inspire me and educate me. I find something ""new"" - or at least new to me - virtually every time I read it.This time I paid closer attention to some of the minor characters, especially the women - Calpurnia, Aunt Alexandra, Helen Robinson, Mrs Merriweather, Lula, Miss Maudie, Mrs Dubose, Miss Caroline, and Mayella Ewell. I was struck by what a wide range of personalities, strengths, weaknesses, and ethics Lee was able to express using just these minor characters (some appearing for only a page or two) living in a small town.Many people feel this is a book about racism. I don't think that is the core theme of this book, though it is the central plot device Lee uses. I think the major theme of the book is personal integrity and courage - doing what you know is right when all about you seemingly disagree and even when it may be dangerous to do so, being true to your own moral compass, and instilling those values in your children by example not just words.In 2010 I listened to the audio book, performed by Academy-Award-winning actress Sissy Spacek.

Can they communicate with us now? Hello From Heaven! is the first complete study of an exciting new field of research called After-Death Communication, or ADC.

The Bomb,"From the author of the classic The Wizards of Armageddon and Pulitzer Prize finalist comes the definitive history of American policy on nuclear war—and Presidents’ actions in nuclear crises—from Truman to Trump. Fred Kaplan, hailed by The New York Times as “a rare combination of defense intellectual and pugnacious reporter,” takes us into the White House Situation Room, the Joint Chiefs of Staff’s “Tank” in the Pentagon, and the vast chambers of Strategic Command to bring us the untold stories—based on exclusive interviews and previously classified documents—of how America’s presidents and generals have thought about, threatened, broached, and just barely avoided nuclear war from the dawn of the atomic age until today.

"Leaves of grass,","Leaves of Grass is a poetry collection by the American poet Walt Whitman (1819–1892). Though the first edition was published in 1855, Whitman spent his entire life writing and re-writing Leaves of Grass, revising it in several editions until his death. This resulted in vastly different editions over four decades—the first a small book of twelve poems and the last a compilation of over 400 poems.The poems of Leaves of Grass are loosely connected and each represents Whitman's celebration of his philosophy of life and humanity. This book is notable for its discussion of delight in sensual pleasures during a time when such candid displays were considered immoral. Where much previous poetry, especially English, relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, Leaves of Grass (particularly the first edition) exalted the body and the material world. Influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalist movement, itself an offshoot of Romanticism, Whitman's poetry praises nature and the individual human's role in it. However, much like Emerson, Whitman does not diminish the role of the mind or the spirit; rather, he elevates the human form and the human mind, deeming both worthy of poetic praise.",['Walt Whitman'],Createspace Independent Pub,2014-09-09,['Poetry'],B00085U4D0,A1J44FKMMLH4BG,0/0,5.0,1353456000,Excellent text,Excellent text and excellent service.I hate that they force us to write these reviews.I hate that they force us to write these reviews.,2014,en

Square, introduces the readers to the customs, class distinctions (based on geometric shape), male and female roles, how to tell one another apart, and on general life living in a world of only two dimensions. Square's life is turned upside down when, on the eve of the new millenium, a strange visitor literally drops into his home. This visitor - a Sphere - has chosen Square as his apostle to teach the two-dimensional masses about how more to life there is beyond their flat world view.At first glance, this comes across as a novel about higher math: geometry, 2- and 3-dimensions, the possiblity of higher cimensions after the third, etc. Author Edwin Abbott examines and illustrates what life would be like living in such flat world, in which everyone resembles a straight line - whether the ""person"" is a circle, a triangle, or a square - because only one side of them can be seen. On a deeper level, though, Abbott offers a scathing parody of Victorian society. (After all, the book was first published in the late 1880s.) Class distinction based on birth is rampant. The ""lower"" beings, such as isocoles triangles and irregular shapes, live in shame and are looked down upon by society. They will never attain the good paying jobs or respectability that those shapes with more sides have. Women are seen as merely lines, very dangerous to society, though, so they must be kept uneducated. Their main purpose is to help their male counterparts achieve higher and higher status through breeding.Quite a remarkable book for its time.",2012,en

Fire From Heaven,"New York Times Bestseller and Man Booker Prize Finalist: A novel of ancient Greece by the author Hilary Mantel calls “a shining light.” Alexander the Great stands alone as a leader and strategist, and Fire from Heaven is Mary Renault’s unsurpassed dramatization of the formative years of his life. His parents fight for their precocious son’s love: On one side, his volatile father, Philip, and on the other, his overbearing mother, Olympias. The story tells of the conqueror’s two great bonds—to his horse, Oxhead, and to his dearest friend and eventual lover, Hephaistion—and of the army he commands when he is barely an adult. Coming of age during the battles for southern Greece, Alexander the Great appears in all of his colors—as the man who first takes someone’s life at age twelve and who swiftly eliminates his rivals as soon as he comes to power—and emerges as a captivating, complex, larger-than-life figure. Fire from Heaven is the first volume of the Novels of Alexander the Great trilogy, which continues with The Persian Boy and Funeral Games. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Mary Renault including rare images of the author. “Mary Renault is a shining light to both historical novelists and their readers. She does not pretend the past is like the present, or that the people of ancient Greece were just like us.

Anna Karenina - translated from the Russian by Constance Garnett,"""Anna Karenina"" is the tragic story of Countess Anna Karenina, a married noblewoman and socialite, and her affair with the affluent Count Vronsky.

Some of these topics include an evaluation of the feudal system that existed in Russia at the time—politics, not only in the Russian government but also at the level of the individual characters and families, religion, morality, gender and social class. Leo Tolstoy (1828–1910) was a Russian writer who is regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time.

The woman who lives there, Gloria, is the most glamorous neighbour on the avenue, owning a fashionable dress shop in Bexhill-on-Sea. But who is the woman who arrives in the black car most Saturdays while Gloria is at work? Sometimes she brings women to the house, other times they have children. Hilda, Katy's mother, disapproves of Gloria. She wonders if these mysterious visitors have just been released from prison. Is Gloria secretly bringing criminals, or worse, into the heart of the community? Then one night, the house burns down. In the wreckage, the bodies of Gloria and her daughter are found. Katy is sure the unexplained visitors must be responsible until her father is arrested and charged with murder. Have the police arrested the correct person? Are the rest of the street safe?

The story is a boy's description of another kid across the street, who's a bit older and has four dogs and never loses at anything and whose parents never argue. Gradually it becomes clear that the narrator is making most of it up; his description is really a comment on all the things he doesn't like about his own family. I like the book because its message is that it's ok to resent your parents' rules, at the same time that it shows how spoiled someone might become without these rules. I also like it that it has taught my daughter that you can't always believe what a narrator tells you, which is kind of fun to talk about. Plus there's lot of silliness that my daughter loves (the boy across the street has a shark pool!), the illustrations are full of wit, and the narration captures the voice of a lonely boy telling a tall tale. The ending is odd -- the narrator talks about how he likes to imagine going over to the other kid's house and making friends with him, and then he say, ""I spend the night there"" -- & that's the end. But I like even this, because kids really do tell stories that have abrupt endings, and it shows how easily the narrator goes from imaginging something to really believing it. Great book, interesting for my daughter and for me.",2018,en

This book would get five stars for the Prohibition poem alone: &quot;...it doesn't prohibit worth a dime/Nevertheless, we're for it!&quot; One of the most interesting parts was what Allen doesn't - and couldn't - write about. Only Yesterday was written in 1931, before the full effects of Versailles had been felt. Viewed in that light, Allen's portrait of Wilson, while romanticized, astutely outlines why Wilson's ideas for the peace treaty were wise, and why they were so unlikely to ever be realized. From hemlines to geopolitics, Allen pulls it all together in a fascinating book.",2015,en

Wendy takes you step by step through the process, and also gives you checklists to refer to as you put your deal together. She does however make some broad assumptions from time to time about when either type of contract is beneficial and why. For example, she mentions that owners with good credit are more likely to entertain a lease-option than a subject-to. This is not always the case. Sometimes owners with bad credit are looking for a ""leg up"", but don't want to surrender title. In that case, they actually might prefer a lease-option. Also in my experience, many owners with good credit prefer a subject-to because they want their name off the title, but don't want to deal with the tax hit of selling the property outright, right now. If they enter a subject-to, they can have their mortgage payments made by the investor, and give them time to have the property reclassified from ""primary residence"" to ""investment property"". They can then do 1031 exchanges tax free once the investor is ready to close (usually more than 1-2 years down the line.Overall though, this book is a must if you want to learn about the ins and outs of lease-options and subject-tos.",2011,en

I wouldn't be able to watch children starving to death on my 5 t.v. sets while thinking about how I am going to increase my income so that I can watch 10 t.v. sets at the same time. Life on Pala is much too earnest. Too much serious pursuit of health and happiness. I would need to let off steam in the same way that the Puritans had a respite from their quest for total goodness by frying a few witches. Total happiness is, like total goodness, too demanding. No wonder the residents of Pala don't seem perturbed that an evil dictator might take over their paradise one day. They are secretly as fed up with the pursuit of happiness as any normal person would be. That's why they choose not to use their superior psycho-spiritual skills to dreamweave the continued existence of their life-style.Virtually every ingredient of Pala's utopian system exists, or has existed at some time in humanity's history. If you end up calling this book a spoof it's because your lifestyle, values, or values have been brought into question by Huxley's probing book, and you can't find a reasonable reply. Huxley is angry at the rottenness of society, angry that nobody REALLY wants a less rotten society, and angry that people cannot see that a less rotten society is NOT a utopian dream - that there IS a way to a better world.New Agers should get out of their sweat lodges, put away their crystals and read this book. Then they would really know ""What's What and What It Might be Reasonable to Do about What's What."" Or at least have a better idea what New Age is really about, and how it developed. Actually everyone would benefit from reading this book. It should be compulsory reading in all schools. It helps removes the blinkers of rigid thoughts and beliefs. Although it is much more fun to watch WWF, sick movies, state-sanctioned murder by lethal injection, and bombs being dropped on foreign countries than to think or dream about, or try to create Utopia.But Utopian Pala is also bit like Life itself? Both were created by the union of opposites. In Pala's case it was a union of science and mysticism. In both Life and Pala people prefer not to think that existence as they know it might, or will, end one day. And if it must end - what comes next? More of the same? Some things continue while other's don't - like the soul might continue while the body doesn't? Or is the ending total, final, absolute? Nothing continues?This book raises more questions than it answers - questions that will always demand attention. That's why I liked it so much.",2018,en

There's nothing to identify the stranger, but the doctor on board finds a small microfilm while surgically removing the bullets.When the man regains consciousness, he can't remember who or where he is and what happened to him. His only solid connection to his past is the microfilm, which contains a long string of numbers that sucks him into a whirlwind intrigue of black ops assassinations, government coverups, and corrupt politicians...and he's the epicenter of it all.If that kind of opening doesn't make you want to read the book, then it isn't for you. :)The premise is just plain fun. Since the beginning of civilization, Man has wondered if he has lived before and if so, why he can't remember. The Bourne Identity takes that ancient mystery and makes a great spy thriller out of it.The plot is structured very well and the pacing is impeccable. It speeds up and slows down in the perfect spots and really builds the tension and mystery as you move through it. It was also intricate enough to make you think about it when not reading and try to actively figure it out, but not so complex as to overwhelm you with details.If you're a guy, it's only a matter of time before you wish you were Jason Bourne. He's tough, smart, and incredibly resourceful, but not invincible enough to make you roll your eyes. The prime villain is kept mysterious, but is a formidable enemy for Bourne, which makes for a good protagonist vs. antagonist battle.My only (minor) complaint is that the other characters were a bit cardboard. Marie had a little bit of depth, but most of the supporting cast only existed to forward the plot, which was all about Bourne. His plight is so enthralling, however, that you will hardly care.If you like a fast-paced thriller with an intellectual flair to it, then you'll love this book.P.S. The movie was awesome too. They did a great job taking the first half of the book and making a tight, entertaining movie out of it.",2012,en
Lord of the flies,"William Golding’s unforgettable classic of boyhood adventure and the savagery of humanity comes to Penguin Classics in a stunning Graphic Deluxe Edition with a new foreword by Lois Lowry As provocative today as when it was first published in 1954, Lord of the Flies continues to ignite passionate debate with its startling, brutal portrait of human nature. William Golding’s compelling story about a group of very ordinary boys marooned on a coral island has been labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, and even a vision of the apocalypse. But above all, it has earned its place as one of the indisputable classics of the twentieth century for readers of any age. This Penguin Classics Graphic Deluxe Edition features an array of special features to supplement the novel, including a foreword by Lois Lowry, an introduction by Stephen King, an essay by E. M. Forster, an essay on teaching and reading the novel and suggestions for further exploration by scholar Jennifer Buehler, and an extended note by E. L. Epstein, the publisher of the first American paperback edition of Lord of the Flies. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

I felt that the book was a little too predictable. I was surprised that this was Golding's response to the evils he saw in WWII as a member of the Royal Navy, because I figured it would be more graphic or have been about the war, rather than the story of a group of English schoolboys whose plane is shot down on an island. At the beginning of the book when Ralph calls all the boys who survived the plane crash with the conch and they voted him leader over Jack, I could tell that the conflict of the story would be between these characters. I did not feel like Golding was able to get across his theme of the inner evil of mankind because of his character choice of a group of young boys. From personal experience I can tell you that almost all young boys are mischievous and have an evil side to them, but I don't feel that they are an accurate representation of all humans. However, I do feel that Golding used a lot of great symbolism in this novel with the use of Piggy's glasses as being able to see things for what they really are, and the use of the conch to represent power and order. Another interesting thing is Beelzebub, one of the fallen angels in Milton's Paradise Lost, translates to Lord of the Flies.

"Nathaniel's Nutmeg: Or, the True and Incredible Adventures of the Spice Trader Who Changed the Course of History","A true tale of high adventure in the South Seas. The tiny island of Run is an insignificant speck in the Indonesian archipelago. Just two miles long and half a mile wide, it is remote, tranquil, and, these days, largely ignored. Yet 370 years ago, Run's harvest of nutmeg (a pound of which yielded a 3,200 percent profit by the time it arrived in England) turned it into the most lucrative of the Spice Islands, precipitating a battle between the all-powerful Dutch East India Company and the British Crown. The outcome of the fighting was one of the most spectacular deals in history: Britain ceded Run to Holland but in return was given Manhattan. This led not only to the birth of New York but also to the beginning of the British Empire. Such a deal was due to the persistence of one man. Nathaniel Courthope and his small band of adventurers were sent to Run in October 1616, and for four years held off the massive Dutch navy. Nathaniel's Nutmeg centers on the remarkable showdown between Courthope and the Dutch Governor General Jan Coen, and the brutal fate of the mariners racing to Run-and the other corners of the globe-to reap the huge profits of the spice trade. Written with the flair of a historical sea novel but based on rigorous research, Giles Milton's Nathaniel's Nutmeg is a brilliant adventure story by a writer who has been hailed as the ""new Bruce Chatwin"" (Mail on Sunday).",['Giles Milton'],Picador,2015-06-02,['History'],B000OXLFRK,ACQULNOU5ZJBP,4/8,4.0,930182400,Interesting History,"This is an enjoyable book to read, easy to get into and hard to put down.

Bareback,"This book analyses contemporary gay ""pig"" masculinities, which have emerged alongside antiretroviral therapies, online porn, and new sexualised patterns of recreational drug use, examining how they trouble modern European understandings of the male body, their ethics, and their political underpinnings. This is the first book to reflect on an increasingly visible new form of sexualised gay masculinity, and the first monograph to move debates on condomless sex amongst gay men beyond discourses of HIV and/or AIDS. It contributes to existing critical histories of sexuality, pornography and other sex media at a crucial juncture in the history of gay male sex cultures and the HIV epidemic. The book draws from fieldwork, interviews, archival research, visual analysis, philosophy, queer theory, and cultural studies, using empirical, critical, and speculative methodologies to better think gay ""pig"" masculinities across their material, affective, ethical and political dimensions, in a future-oriented, politically-inflected, reflection on what queer bodies may become. Spanning historical context to empirical and theoretical study, Bareback Porn, Porous Masculinities, Queer Futures will be of key interest to academics and students in sexuality studies, film, media, visual culture, cultural studies, and porn studies concerned with masculinities, sex and sexualities and their circulation across an array of media.",['João Florêncio'],Routledge,2020-07-22,['Social Science'],1933389192,A1J1Z7BWHX25PE,0/0,5.0,1355184000,One of my favorite now!!!!,"When I started reading this book, I just knew it was going to end up on my favorite list.

Qed: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter,"Celebrated for his brilliantly quirky insights into the physical world, Nobel laureate Richard Feynman also possessed an extraordinary talent for explaining difficult concepts to the general public. Here Feynman provides a classic and definitive introduction to QED (namely, quantum electrodynamics), that part of quantum field theory describing the interactions of light with charged particles. Using everyday language, spatial concepts, visualizations, and his renowned ""Feynman diagrams"" instead of advanced mathematics, Feynman clearly and humorously communicates both the substance and spirit of QED to the layperson.

Yet, here Feynman admirably succeeds in distilling the essence of QED-quantum electrodynamics-, one of our most fundamental theories of nature, without using any mathematical equations. Comprehending what is presented in this book still requires a fair amount of attention and mental work on the part of the reader, but the reward is understanding something about the fundamental workings of nature that the overwhelming majority of people unfortunately don't and, even worse, are not even aware that they don't.I recommend using this book in conjunction with a set of lectures Feynman gave on this topic, and which are fortunately freely available from the Vega Science trust (Do a search for ""Feynman Robb lectures"" to find them).The content is about the same, but whereas the strength of the lectures is that they make the material seem more accessible (due to the brilliance of Feynman as a lecturer), the book is useful for long-term reinforcement.In my opinion, the book and lecture combination should be seriously considered for inclusion into the high school science curriculum. I think the material is not too advanced for that level, and if more people had their basic worldview shaken at that age, it would provide them with at least one profound experience that what they know (from their sensory experience) just ain't so.

The running man,"A desperate man attempts to win a reality TV game where the only objective is to stay alive in this #1 national bestseller from Stephen King, writing as Richard Bachman. It was the ultimate death game in a nightmare future America. The year is 2025 and reality TV has grown to the point where people are willing to wager their lives for a chance at a billion-dollar jackpot. Ben Richards is desperate—he needs money to treat his daughter’s illness. His last chance is entering a game show called The Running Man where the goal is to avoid capture by Hunters who are employed to kill him. Surviving this month-long chase is another issue when everyone else on the planet is watching—and willing to turn him in for the reward.

The economic distinction between classes is much more stark, and the only opportunity for the poor to rise through the socio-economic ranks is to volunteer for life-threatening game shows.The protagonist, a married victim of the old economy who is unable to find suitable employment, is unable to pay for basic medication that would save his infant daughter's life.

THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA,"The Phantom of the Opera is a novel by French writer Gaston Leroux. Christine Daaé travels with her father, a famous fiddler, throughout Europe, and plays folk and religious music. When Christine was six years old, her mother died and her father was taken to rural France by a patron, Professor Valerius. While Christine was a child, her father told her many stories about the ""Angel of Music"", who is the personification of musical inspiration. Christine meets and befriends the young Raoul, Viscount of Chagny. One of Christine and Raoul's favourite stories is one of Little Lotte, a girl who is visited by the Angel of Music and possesses a heavenly voice. Christine now lives with ""Mamma"" Valerius, the elderly widow of her father's benefactor. She eventually is given a position in the chorus at the Paris Opera House (Palais Garnier). She begins hearing a beautiful, unearthly voice which sings to her and speaks to her. She believes this must be the Angel of Music and asks him if he is. The Voice agrees and offers to teach her ""a little bit of heaven's music"". The Voice, however, belongs to Erik, a physically deformed and mentally disturbed musical genius who was one of the architects who took part in the construction of the opera house.

Secret Fighting Arts of the World,"Here is a book crammed full of secret fighting techniques never before divulged in print: the Oriental delayed death touch, the destruction wrought on by the fingertips of an obscure Mexican; the shout of doom; the method so terrible it is practiced only in Russian torture chambers, the niceties of Thugee strangulation; and many more vicious fighting tricks. Suppressed for generations! Twenty of the world's most secretly guarded fighting techniques vividly described in one volume. The average reader will find this book amazing--almost unbelievable.

Gilbey'],Tuttle Publishing,2011-12-06,['Sports & Recreation'],0804805156,A16DVNTU6L435K,15/15,5.0,1135123200,The author wrote this as a satire on martial arts!,"If you thought this book was intended to be a serious book on martial arts, you were both right and wrong. When I first read the book as a teenaged martial artist in the early `60's, I was blown away by it and believed every word. It's underlying philosophy more than anything else about it influenced my early martial arts development. Then in about 1976-77, a Tai Chi friend of mine by the name of John Panter told me he thought that ""John F. Gilbey"" was probably a pen name for Robert W. Smith, Don Draeger, and some of the crowd Smith and Draeger hung out with in Asia. He guessed this based on the writing style and content that was similar to their other writings.Years later, Robert Smith came out and explained exactly how he and a group of friends (all senior martial artists including Draeger who were Westerners trained in Japan and China) got the idea of writing a spoof about the martial arts. They made up the name, ""John F. Gilbey,"" and invented a personal history for the name that combined their actual martial arts credentials. The book turned out to be a great success, but not as they had planned. Unfortunately for them, so many people believed that ""John F. Gilbey"" was a real person and the book a completely true book, that it took on a life of it's own and only added to the wild tales about martial arts that became popularized in the West. This happened because Smith was so skilled at interweaving fact with fiction that he unwittingly produced a satire that many found believable as complete ""fact."" Robert Smith later wrote an even more wild sequel to the book thinking that would finally enlighten people, but once again, he was wrong. Finally, he just came out in the martial arts magazine, ""Journal Of Asian Martial Arts,"" and told the true story. He later repeated it in his book, ""Martial Musings.""Here's a bit of what Robert Smith said: ""Gilbey was a joke, an exaggeration, a fantasy. He had money, time, and amazing skill in everything. We were sure that readers would be smart enough to realize this. We were wrong....'Secret Fighting Arts of the World' contained some truth, plus many whoppers."" If you want a longer explanation of what was truth and what was whoppers, I highly recommend reading ""Martial Musings,"" which I think is Smith's best work.But my tale of this book doesn't end there. I recently learned that back in the `70's my old friend, John Panter, actually used a technique from the book in a real situation! When I quizzed him on it, here's what Panter said: ""It was the Macedonian Buttock! I was coming home from work on the Subway in Toronto. It was my last day on that job and I was carrying my work clothes in a bag along with my lunch kit and some other stuff, all under my arms. I had to get off at the Bay St. Station to see if something I had lost was at the Lost and Found there. Of course, since construction jobs let out at 4:30, I hit Bay Street just in time for all the office workers who get out at 5:00 to be heading home. Well, when I had to get out, I was faced with a wall of people trying to get in, and I realized that if I got jostled at all, I would lose all my stuff and it would get trampled before I could pick it up. Now the etiquette is supposed to be that people getting off have right of way, but that wasn't working this time, and there was this great big meat head coming straight toward me. I quickly turned sideways to him, and rotated my shoulders further so that the things I had under my arm weren't in line with my hips, and when he ran into me I let him have the buttock thrust. I purposefully waited `til he was against me so that it was a push, not an impact. I wanted to move him, not hurt him. In any event, he went flying backward, and fell spread-eagled on top of two or three rows of other people that were behind him. I can still remember the look of total astonishment on his face as I stepped past him."" One final note here. John Panter went on to become the head of the Taoist Tai Chi Society's entire Atlantic Region in Canada. I remain just another average Black Belt level martial artist...In conclusion, this book is a fun read for entertainment, cut-to-the-core insight, and deadpan satire. Smith has a sense of amused perspective on oneself, history, and the fighting arts. The writing style is great, and I highly recommend it. Just remember that the author intended this as a spoof!",2011,en
The Coffee Book: Anatomy of an Industry from Crop to the Last Drop,"A history of coffee from the sixth century to Starbucks that’s “good to the last sentence” (Las Cruces Sun News). One of Library Journal’s “Best Business Books” This updated edition of The Coffee Book is jammed full of facts, figures, cartoons, and commentary covering coffee from its first use in Ethiopia in the sixth century to the rise of Starbucks and the emergence of Fair Trade coffee in the twenty-first. The book explores the process of cultivation, harvesting, and roasting from bean to cup; surveys the social history of café society from the first coffeehouses in Constantinople to beatnik havens in Berkeley and Greenwich Village; and tells the dramatic tale of high-stakes international trade and speculation for a product that can make or break entire national economies. It also examines the industry’s major players, revealing the damage that’s been done to farmers, laborers, and the environment by mass cultivation—and explores the growing “conscious coffee” market. “Drawing on sources ranging from Molière and beatnik cartoonists to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the authors describe the beverage’s long and colorful rise to ubiquity.” —The Economist “Most stimulating.” —The Baltimore Sun","['Nina Luttinger', 'Gregory Dicum']","New Press, The",2012-05-01,['Business & Economics'],1565845080,AGBRTPPIJT6UK,14/18,5.0,1049414400,Coffee could be worse than cattle!,"Mr.Dicum and Ms.Luttinger have writtne a phenomenal book.

During the years of 1941 (rise of Hitler) Elie Wiesel takes you back when he was about 12 and faced the terrifying struggles of the Jewish extermination. Early on in the book Elie is taught the importance of the Jewish faith and the existence of God through his mentor and guide, Moshe the Beadle.Night is the only word to define these darkest moments in time. The only time he dreamed of is the day it would finally be over. News continues to sweep through the town of Sighet, Transylvania but the Jews don't listen and its too late! Madame Schachter moans progress to hysterical cries ""Fire! A terrible fire! Mercy! Oh, that fire!"" That same day of arrival at the concentration camp Elie looks in horror at the flames rising above huge ovens and the smell of burning human flesh. He is a survivor of these death camps.Elie and his father depart to Auschwitz and his mother and three sisters disappear to Birkenau. Every day Elie is deported to a different death camp. He is told to strip naked of all his clothes in the bare winter and get his head shaved. He only get shoes and clothes that are too small in return. You have to keep good health and for many it was unfair and impossible. He recalls, ""I was a body. Perhaps less than that even: a starved stomach. The stomach alone was aware of the passage of time."" Not many looked and stayed healthy. Elie's questions the existence of God.Like robots, the Jews run, run, run. You run all day to the next camp that you were to face and it's cold, very cold. This was just another way to eliminate the Jews faster. Anyone whom fell behind was shot on the spot. You never get a good night's sleep and if you never awoke it's most likely because you're gone. Food is never enough. How does Elie survive with only a ration of bread every day?

McCaffrey originally intended to call *this* book _Get *Of* the Unicorn_, but she felt that the name suggested by a printing error had more pizzazz. The cover art on the current edition is from &quot;The Smallest Dragonboy&quot;, the only Pern story in the book.My first thought when _The Rowan_ came out, and again when I first leafed through _Freedom's Landing_: &quot;She decided to roll those ideas out of storage after all.&quot; It's been a little surreal, wondering if I alone remembered the original short stories. :)&quot;Lady in the Tower&quot; (1959) and &quot;A Meeting of Minds&quot; (1969) - the predecessors to _The Rowan_ and _Damia_.&quot;Daughter&quot; (1971), &quot;Dull Drums&quot; (1973) - Nick and Nora (no, not Charles, but Fenn) are the twin children of a farmer who's obsessed with having Nick enter the family business (he couldn't care much less about his daughter, or that Nick wants to work with animals instead). Guess which twin gets the higher scholastic scores? &quot;Daughter&quot; is a bit predictable, but these two stories are OK, really. They're set in what would now be the near future; the academic system works differently. The vibes are a bit like the _Pegasus_ universe, to me, without the ESP.&quot;Changeling&quot; - This self-described 'unusual experiment in human relationships' seems to have some gaping plot holes. Claire, living with Roy and Ellyot (who have a relationship), apparently married her husband, Chess, mostly to have children. The story never covers the details of how Chess went from storming out of his first meeting with Roy to the point of not only moving in, but accepting `oh by the way, I want to have Roy's child first, by artificial insemination'. We're not told, much less shown, how/why Chess changed his attitude; in fact, the story jumps from `architect for the new kitchen' to `husband' in about a paragraph.&quot;Weather on Welladay&quot; (1969) - This one was written to fit the cover art of the magazine it originally appeared in. Whaling, on Welladay, means 'milking' the whales for radioactive iodine - now someone's pirating iodine and leaving whales to die.&quot;The Thorns of Barevi&quot; (1970) - The origin of the Freedom series; originally written to cash in on the soft-porn market, as mentioned by an earlier reviewer.&quot;Horse from a Different Sea&quot; - This is a sly reversal of the 'aliens need our women' type of plot in movies like &quot;I Married a Monster from Outer Space&quot; (not a bad movie, actually). Here, the alien passing herself off as a prostitute needs men - but *they're* the ones who become pregnant. The town doctor is the narrator for this one. Most of them are grown men cheating on their wives; the Boy Scout mentioned by a previous reviewer is an exception.&quot;Great Canine Chorus&quot; (1971) - One night on their beat, Pete Roberts' K-9 partner, Wizard, acts a bit as though he's possessed. He is - by Maria, a 9-year-old telepath suffering from neglect. She has several parapsychic abilities, compensating for being blind, deaf, and paralyzed - and she's terrified of being taken away and cut up because her body doesn't work right. Enough that she uses her powers to keep Roberts from doing anything more than sending food to her via Wizard. Then she figures out other ways to get what she wants...&quot;Finder's Keeper&quot; (1973) - Young Peter Anderson has a carefully concealed talent for 'finding'. Since his mother got too sick to work at the diner, he's been using it to help with his part-time work as a caddy (great for finding golf balls). Now Fargo, a sleazy detective, has figured out Peter's secret - and is using the threat of exposure to get Peter to do his own job for free. If you like this one, try Andre Norton's _Red Hart Magic_; Nan Mallory in &quot;The King's Hunters&quot; has the same gift.&quot;A Proper Santa Claus&quot; (1973) - Little Jeremy's wild talent is that he can make his artwork come to life.&quot;The Smallest Dragonboy&quot; (1973) - Keevan is the youngest boy at Benden Weyr who's old enough for Impression when Ramoth's latest clutch hatches. Some of the older candidates (old enough to be getting desperate) start getting their jollies by harassing him. (No wonder they were rejects in previous Impressions.) In later books, he appears as K'van, Heth's rider (even in the index of _Dragonflight_, which includes several characters who hadn't been born yet, e.g. Menolly). Heth was part of Jaxom and Ruth's team in _All the Weyrs of Pern_.&quot;Apple&quot; (1969) - As in, the bad apple that spoils the barrel. The Talents have to hunt down and contain a young woman who has harnessed her abilities, only to cut loose on a crime spree. For best results, you should really read this as part of _To Ride Pegasus_, since it works on the assumption that you know Daffyd and company already.&quot;Honeymoon&quot; - In &quot;The Partnered Ship&quot;, the last story of _The Ship Who Sang_, Helva extended her contract, and acquired Parollan as her new brawn, preparatory to a 2nd mission to Beta Corvi. (&quot;Dramatic Mission&quot; in that book covers mission #1.) &quot;Honeymoon&quot; picks up where &quot;The Partnered Ship&quot; left off - Helva's first voyage with Niall Parollan. You *really* need to read _The Ship Who Sang_ first. (When Parollan's in port, incidentally, he's a party animal - and his idea of a date is a group of triplets.)",2012,en

Haar bekendste werk is Little Women, een autobiografische roman die nog twee vervolgboeken kreeg, en talloze malen bewerkt is tot toneelstukken en films.

The March's have many adventures as they grow up, several of them with their next door neighbor, Teddy Laurence. There is joy and sorrow in their lives, but the love they have for each other carries them through everything.""Little Women"" is old fashioned, sentimental but not too sentimental, and a wonderful book to read. The book is partially autobiographical, based on Louisa May Alcott's own sisters and the love she had for them is evident throughout the book. There are heartbreaking parts which make me cry each and every time I read ""Little Women"", yet there are heartwarming and comical moments that make me smile every time I read it. The four March sisters are very realistic, even Beth, who is almost too good to be true. Alcott was an imaginative writer who could make inanimate objects, such as roses, seem alive.

One for the Money,"Now available in a special 25th anniversary edition! Discover where it all began—#1 New York Times bestselling author Janet Evanovich’s first “snappily written, fast-paced, and witty” (USA TODAY) novel in the beloved Stephanie Plum series featuring a feisty and funny heroine who “comes roaring in like a blast of very fresh air” (The Washington Post). Meet Stephanie Plum, a bounty hunter with attitude. In Stephanie’s opinion, toxic waste, rabid drivers, armed schizophrenics, and August heat, humidity, and hydrocarbons are all part of the great adventure of living in Jersey. She’s a product of the “burg,” a blue-collar pocket of Trenton where houses are attached and narrow, cars are American, windows are clean, and (God forbid you should be late) dinner is served at six. Out of work and out of money, Stephanie blackmails her bail-bondsman cousin Vinnie into giving her a try as an apprehension agent. Stephanie knows zilch about the job requirements, but she figures her new pal, el-primo bounty hunter Ranger, can teach her what it takes to catch a crook. Her first assignment: nail Joe Morelli, a former vice cop on the run from a charge of murder one. Morelli’s the inamorato who charmed Stephanie out of her virginity at age sixteen. There’s still powerful chemistry between them, so the chase should be interesting…and could also be extremely dangerous.",['Janet Evanovich'],Scribner,2019-06-04,['Fiction'],B000CNRC2E,A78TQDLANNQRN,0/0,5.0,1360713600,Awesome,same as HIGH FIVE I just enjoy these books so much I read some books that my sister had in hard back and when I got my kindle I started buying them to continue the series.,2019,en
Beginning Linux Programming (Programmer to Programmer),"Beginning Linux Programming, Fourth Edition continues its unique approach to teaching UNIX programming in a simple and structured way on the Linux platform. Through the use of detailed and realistic examples, students learn by doing, and are able to move from being a Linux beginner to creating custom applications in Linux. The book introduces fundamental concepts beginning with the basics of writing Unix programs in C, and including material on basic system calls, file I/O, interprocess communication (for getting programs to work together), and shell programming. Parallel to this, the book introduces the toolkits and libraries for working with user interfaces, from simpler terminal mode applications to X and GTK+ for graphical user interfaces. Advanced topics are covered in detail such as processes, pipes, semaphores, socket programming, using MySQL, writing applications for the GNOME or the KDE desktop, writing device drivers, POSIX Threads, and kernel programming for the latest Linux Kernel.","['Neil Matthew', 'Richard Stones']",John Wiley & Sons,2011-04-22,['Computers'],B000MTEK8M,A1RXT4J2J847CA,24/25,5.0,950054400,An Excellent Primer for Linux Programming,"This is a really cool book, not only technically, but a decent read also.

Poole's Breathe, I had high hopes. It seemed like a sweet coming of age story. Yes, our protagonist, ""quintessential hip-hop teenager"", Nafiq, is a clich&eacute;, albeit a potentially intriguing and likeable enough clich&eacute;. There's the promise of a story: Nafiq is the perfect son, the perfect student, the perfect athlete et cetera. When will the pressure make him snap?Fortunately, in the world of Breathe, everyone is flawlessly beautiful, sexy, sought after and popular - but only if they're African-American, or, at a stretch, Latino. Breathe, you see, desperately wants to be part of that stable of blaxploitation crap that James Earl Hardy and E. Lynn Harris hail from. You know what I mean - a world of conservative, successful, beautiful black folk who go to church, preach the value of family, and in the meantime, get up to all sorts of soap opera nastiness on the down low; lying, cheating and sexing everyone and anyone (but only if they're flawlessly beautiful, sexy, successful, sought after and popular African-American). Oh, and deriding white folk at every opportunity is a must - because racism perpetrated against African-Americans is wrong, but wholesale denigration of Caucasians is a badge of honour.Somewhere along the line in Breathe, the author gets bored of Nafiq's story and decides to cut to Nafiq's sister and her down low fianc&eacute;e. Her story is an even longer string of clich&eacute;s, ripped straight from the soaps (or an E. Lynn Harris novel) and told even more clumsily. There's no attempt at insight, or depth. Every negative emotion is depicted along the lines of ""he shook his head sadly"".Well, a puppy might droop its head sadly if you shun it, but a teenager shunned by his parents and kicked out of the parental home doesn't. Maybe the author could invest some of the proceeds from the sales of the book in a good thesaurus.At the end of Breathe I felt truly robbed of my time. I could have been reading something more worthwhile, like a Mills & Boon romance - which at least would have had more depth and a better use on language (and not left such a nasty taste in the mouth).One lesson I did take away from Breathe, however, was a useful counter-argument to the lie that white people are responsible for perpetuating the thug stereotype. Blair R. Poole and his ilk (Hardy et cetera) are all educated, and at least middle-class African-Americans, clearly in the thrall of thug DL culture. Their sole intended audience is the African-American community. Lightweight fluff like Breathe is pure blaxploitation, by black Americans, for upwards of middle-class black Americans, and deliberately and blatantly excludes whites.And that's fine by me - Mister Poole, you're welcome to keep you hypocrisy, your lies, your church, and your grim stereotypes. It's all yours - I hope you and your flawlessly beautiful, sexy, sought after and popular African-American brothas have a great time with it all.",2020,en
The Four Feathers,"The Four Feathers is a 1902 adventure novel by British writer A. E. W. Mason that has inspired many films of the same title. In December 1901, Cornhill Magazine announced the title as one of two new serial stories to be published in the forthcoming year. Against the background of the Mahdist War, young Feversham disgraces himself by quitting the army, which others perceive as cowardice, symbolized by the four white feathers they give him.

Upon discovering his regiment is to be sent to war in the Sudan Harry resigns his commission to avoid the conflict. Harry's closest friends discover what he has done and give him four white feathers which signify his cowardice. The disgrace of being seen as a coward by those he cares for forces Harry to redeem himself for what he has done. The story follows Feversham's adventures as he goes to the Sudan to regain his lost honor. The story also examines the lives of those who branded him a coward as they begin to discover Harry's true character and are forced to deal with the decisions they made that sent Harry to the Sudan.The Four Feathers is a very exciting story that immerses the reader in the lives of the characters in the story. The reader can easily identify with the problems that each character must endure throughout the story. The reader is drawn into the relationships that the characters share with one another and begin to truly care for what happens to each individual.Mason's literary style allows the novel to flow smoothly. Although the story moves from place to place and character to character the reader is able to maintain a clear understanding of what is taking place. The novel itself is very entertaining and easy to read.I personally enjoyed this story a great deal. The book is told on a grand scope that took me through the history of the time and gave me a better understanding of culture and life in Victorian Britain.

Figure drawing,"Many of us want to learn “how to draw.” But as artist Anthony Ryder explains, it’s much more important to learn what to draw. In other words, to observe and draw what we actually see, rather than what we think we see. When it comes to drawing the human figure, this means letting go of learned ideas and expectation of what the figure should look like. It means carefully observing the interplay of form and light, shape and line, that combine to create the actual appearance of human form. In The Artist’s Complete Guide to Figure Drawing, amateur and experienced artists alike are guided toward this new way of seeing and drawing the figure with a three-step drawing method. The book’s progressive course starts with the block-in, an exercise in seeing and establishing the figure’s shape. It then build to the contour, a refined line drawing that represents the figure’s silhouette. The last step is tonal work on the inside of the contour, when light and shadow are shaped to create the illusion of form. Separate chapters explore topics critical to the method: gesture, which expresses a sense of living energy to the figure; light, which largely determines how we see the model; and form, which conveys the figure’s volume and mass. Examples, step-by-steps, and special “tips” offer helpful hints and practical guidance throughout. Lavishly illustrated with the author’s stunning artwork, The Artist’s Complete Guide to Figure Drawing combines solid instruction with thoughtful meditations on the art of drawing, to both instruct and inspire artists of all levels.",['Anthony Ryder'],Watson-Guptill,2014-03-02,['Art'],B0007F08DW,A1HZPVZ42H97IE,4/4,5.0,1314576000,Finally!

Most of the stories are quite good, such as ""Usher II"" which anticipates Fahrenheit 451 with a story of censorship and resistance to totalitarian bureaucracy, as is the book taken as a whole.The one major issue that is a little hard to swallow, even on the books own terms, is why practically all the human settlers of Mars, many of whom left Earth precisely to escape the threat of war, would return to Earth as soon as war actually breaks out.

Mustang 1964-1/2-1973,"The first-generation Mustang is an enduring classic but it was built using 50-year-old technology. These cars use antiquated equipment that includes drum brakes, breaker points ignition systems, and 14-inch steel wheels. The OEM running gear is obsolete by today’s standards but all of these Mustangs can turn into high-performance street machines that can compete with late-model Mustangs. While certain special-build and high-performance models should be preserved, many common V-8 Mustangs can be transformed into high-performance cars that rival the new cars of today. The Mustang can be upgraded and modified into a true driving machine by installing aftermarket suspension, steering, and driveline technology. Mustang expert and former Ford engineer Frank Bohanan explains how to perform simple and important bolt-on upgrades that radically increase performance. He explains the rationale and process of installing a crate engine, big high-performance brake kits, coil-over shocks, tubular A-arms, multi-link rear suspension, and many other projects that increase performance by leaps and bounds. From mild to wild, you are shown how to upgrade each component group in the car by stages according to budget and difficulty. These components include engine, transmission, rear differential, front suspension, rear suspension, steering, chassis, electrics, interior, tires, wheels, and more. By completing these procedures and product installs, you can complete an improved street car, a high-performance street car, or a street/track-day car.

Political Science Research Methods,"This text starts by explaining the fundamental goal of good political science research—the ability to answer interesting and important questions by generating valid inferences about political phenomena. Before the text even discusses the process of developing a research question, the authors introduce the reader to what it means to make an inference and the different challenges that social scientists face when confronting this task. Only with this ultimate goal in mind will students be able to ask appropriate questions, conduct fruitful literature reviews, select and execute the proper research design, and critically evaluate the work of others. The authors' primary goal is to teach students to critically evaluate their own research designs and others’ and analyze the extent to which they overcome the classic challenges to making inference: internal and external validity concerns, omitted variable bias, endogeneity, measurement, sampling, and case selection errors, and poor research questions or theory. As such, students will not only be better able to conduct political science research, but they will also be more savvy consumers of the constant flow of causal assertions that they confront in scholarship, in the media, and in conversations with others. Three themes run through Barakso, Sabet, and Schaffner’s text: minimizing classic research problems to making valid inferences, effective presentation of research results, and the nonlinear nature of the research process. Throughout their academic years and later in their professional careers, students will need to effectively convey various bits of information. Presentation skills gleaned from this text will benefit students for a lifetime, whether they continue in academia or in a professional career. Several distinctive features make this book noteworthy: A common set of examples threaded throughout the text give students a common ground across chapters and expose them to a broad range of subfields in the discipline. Box features throughout the book illustrate the nonlinear, ""non-textbook"" reality of research, demonstrate the often false inferences and poor social science in the way the popular press covers politics, and encourage students to think about ethical issues at various stages of the research process.","['Maryann Barakso', 'Daniel M.

The Third Life of Grange Copeland,"From the New York Times–bestselling author of The Color Purple: A “moving, tender” novel of a Deep South tenant farmer’s quest for a new life (Publishers Weekly). Grange Copeland, a deeply conflicted and struggling tenant farmer in the Deep South of the 1930s, leaves his family and everything he’s ever known to find happiness and respect in the cold cities of the North. This misadventure, his “second life,” proves a dismal failure that sends him back where he came from to confront his now-grown-up son’s disastrous relationships with his own family, including Grange’s granddaughter, Ruth Copeland, a child that Grange grows to love. Love becomes the substance of his third and final life. He spends it in devotion to Ruth, teaching and protecting her—though the cost of doing so is almost more than he can bear.

Equally puzzling to many Westerners is the Japanese practice of mizuko rites, in which the parents of aborted fetuses pray for the well-being of these rejected ""lives."" In this provocative investigation, William LaFleur examines abortion as a window on the culture and ethics of Japan. At the same time he contributes to the Western debate on abortion, exploring how the Japanese resolve their conflicting emotions privately and avoid the pro-life/pro-choice politics that sharply divide Americans on the issue.",['William R.

The Nightmare Chronicles,"From New York Times bestselling author Douglas Clegg comes the Bram Stoker Award-winning collection The Nightmare Chronicles -- 13 spine-tingling tales of dark mystery, supernatural thrills and twisted horror which ""can chill the spine so effectively that the reader should keep paramedics on standby, "" says bestselling author Dean Koontz. “Clegg brings his stories together with a chilling fictive conceit....The effect is dangerously seductive.” -- Locus “Clegg's (The Halloween Man, etc.) collection of 13 tales takes risks and is full of passions that sometimes burst forth violently…Clegg's use of innovative metaphors catapults each story beyond a landscape crowded with the horror genre's usual monsters and madmen into a territory he alone can claim.” – Publisher’s Weekly “…Like M. R. James, Douglas Clegg can ‘write about the vile and horrific without seeming to smear it over himself or you.’ Like Shirley Jackson he has an understated precision of language and the ability to portray his characters emotionally in a wickedly effective manner. And, like Stephen King, he loves to tell stories and tells them well. At the same time, Clegg is a thoroughly modern writer...Without doubt, one of the best collections of the year. -- DarkEcho “Every story is perfectly different and definitely unlike any other horror novel/film I’ve read or watched…all of them have their images that could come back to you in your dreams.” – Doubleshot Reviews. “Clegg writes some of the most harrowing, unforgettable tales you're ever likely to come upon.. Clegg's best stories…slip into your subconscious and stay with you well beyond the last turning of the page...” – The Chiaroscuro “I was truly impressed with this collection, and was not surprised to learn that it received the 1999 International Horror Guild Award for Best Collection, and the 1999 Bram Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in a Fiction Collection.” – Casual Debris Contains the short stories ""Underworld"" ""O Rare and Most Exquisite"" ""The Rendering Man"" ""The Fruit of Her Womb"" ""The Hurting Season"" ""Chosen"" ""The Night Before Alec Got Married"" ""Only Connect"" ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Damned If You Do"" ""The Ripening Sweetness of Late Afternoon"" Plus the acclaimed novelettes, ""White Chapel"" and ""I Am Infinite, I Contain Multitudes.""",['Douglas Clegg'],Alkemara Press,2015-02-12,['Fiction'],084394580X,A20CO6CT5EYIS2,3/7,1.0,1140307200,I agree with Bugbug,"I am so sorry that I wasted money on this book.

Howl's Moving Castle,"This entrancing classic fantasy novel is filled with surprises at every turn. An international bestseller, this much-loved book is the source for the Academy Award nominee for Best Animated Feature. Sophie has the great misfortune of being the eldest of three daughters, destined to fail miserably should she ever leave home to seek her fate. But when she unwittingly attracts the ire of the Witch of the Waste, Sophie finds herself under a horrid spell that transforms her into an old lady. Her only chance at breaking it lies in the ever-moving castle in the hills: the Wizard Howl's castle. To untangle the enchantment, Sophie must handle the heartless Howl, strike a bargain with a fire demon, and meet the Witch of the Waste head-on. Along the way, she discovers that there's far more to Howl—and herself—than first meets the eye. In this giant jigsaw puzzle of a fantasy, people and things are never quite what they seem. Destinies are intertwined, identities exchanged, lovers confused. The Witch has placed a spell on Howl. Does the clue to breaking it lie in a famous poem? And what will happen to Sophie Hatter when she enters Howl's castle? All fans of classic fantasy books deserve the pleasure of reading those by Diana Wynne Jones, whose acclaim included the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement. As Neil Gaiman stated, she was ""quite simply the best writer for children of her generation.""

Twelve pages of colour photographs have been added - calculated more to increase sales than to be of use to the traveller on the road.Of the three sections, Part One, The Basics and Part Three, Contexts, are little changed. Between them, Part Two, The Guide, at 1005 pages is 76 pages longer. Regions which get an increase of twenty per cent or more are Dongbei, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hong Kong and Macau.A few new routes have been added, including the roads from Chengdu to Shaanxi and from Mangshi south-east along the Burma border. The book notes the opening of western Sichuan and north-western Yunnan, but unfortunately and oddly provides little information about these important regions. In fact there is very little mention of a vast tract stretching generally south from the Xining-Lhasa road, through Qinghai, the Tibetan &quot;Autonomous&quot; Region and western Sichuan to north-western Yunnan.Although that region warrants much more attention, it is inevitable that there will be some substantial regions that do receive little or no attention. All of north-eastern Sichuan/Chongqing, for example, is a blank. Perhaps it deserves to be; but a traveller is unlikely to find out unless he ventures there and explores for himself. This raises another unfortunate omission - any comprehensive account of which parts of China are still closed to foreign visitors without special permits. That matter is of little importance to travellers wishing to visit the &quot;sights&quot; listed in this guidebook, because few of those &quot;sights&quot; are in closed areas. That is, I expect, why the whole matter of what is closed amounts almost to a non-issue for the popular guidebooks. But it is certainly of importance to the traveller who, having reached this or that province with the help of a guidebook, wishes to go off to see what is in one of the blank areas. Comprehensive lists of what is closed are available, but hard to get, and available nowhere that I know of in English. Such a list, or better still a map of China showing the counties which are closed would be invaluable. That is exactly the kind of information that a guidebook of this kind should provide.The great majority of the changes in this edition are in the detail - admission prices, opening hours, accommodation addresses and prices. Whether the new information is accurate will have to wait for on-the-road testing. But the very large number of detailed changes suggests that the revision has been thorough.There is, of course, the usual and almost inevitable smattering of errors - Dehong described as an &quot;Autonomous Region&quot; (it is an autonomous prefecture) at page 810, Hubei abutting Sichuan (p503: it used to, but not since Chongqing was excised from Sichuan province in about 1997), the map on p773 showing part of Guanxi as incorporated in Guizhou province, Anhui not named on the map at p470, Macau omitted from the table of contents. An important error is the map on p898, showing the &quot;Desert Highway&quot; across the Taklamakan as joining the southern highway at Khotan, more than three hundred kilometres west of the actual junction, which is east of Minfeng (Niya).I would have liked to see more attention to the regional maps rather than the twelve pages of pictures. The maps are, on the whole for their given scope, reasonably well done, fitting in well with the text. Their scale bars are sometimes awry, and maps of adjoining regions are sometimes incompatible - most notably the map of the north-west, which does not fit with the other maps at any scale.So now I come to another special plea. Planning a trip through several regions calls for an overall map. In times gone by, fold-out or loose sheet maps were sometimes provided with guidebooks. Perhaps the practice was abandoned on the grounds of cost; it was not abandoned for lack of usefulness. Of course separate maps are available, but they are much less useful than a map would be if specially prepared for a particular guidebook - less useful because they include so many places not mentioned in the book, omit some that are, and in China may even use different names. After wrestling with adjustments to scales different from those indicated by scale bars I produced a single map of China from the regional maps in the new Rough Guide, and a most useful map it is for use in conjunction with the book.When next I travel to China, the new edition of the Rough Guide will be the one I shall take, supplemented where needed and possible by information from other sources.

1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus,"Hoe de wereld zich ontwikkelde na de ontdekking van Amerika De reizen van Columbus vormden het begin van een bijzondere uitwisseling van flora en fauna tussen Eurazië en Noord- en Zuid-Amerika. Zo vonden onder meer tomaten, aardappelen, maïs, zilver en rubber hun weg naar Eurazië, en omgekeerd zijde, paarden, graan, koffie, appels - en slaven niet te vergeten - naar Noord- en Zuid-Amerika. Een minder welkome uitwisseling was uiteraard die van insecten, bacteriën en virussen. Charles Mann laat zien dat deze zogeheten Columbian Exchange heeft gezorgd voor de opkomst van Europa, de ondergang van het Chinese keizerrijk en de verstoring van de ecologie in Afrika. Met 1493 heeft bestsellerauteur Charles Mann de belangrijkste biologische gebeurtenis sinds het uitsterven van de dinosauriërs onder de aandacht van een groot publiek weten te brengen.

Patterns of Language,"You can use this book to design a house for yourself with your family; you can use it to work with your neighbors to improve your town and neighborhood; you can use it to design an office, or a workshop, or a public building. And you can use it to guide you in the actual process of construction. After a ten-year silence, Christopher Alexander and his colleagues at the Center for Environmental Structure are now publishing a major statement in the form of three books which will, in their words, ""lay the basis for an entirely new approach to architecture, building and planning, which will we hope replace existing ideas and practices entirely."" The three books are The Timeless Way of Building, The Oregon Experiment, and this book, A Pattern Language. At the core of these books is the idea that people should design for themselves their own houses, streets, and communities. This idea may be radical (it implies a radical transformation of the architectural profession) but it comes simply from the observation that most of the wonderful places of the world were not made by architects but by the people. At the core of the books, too, is the point that in designing their environments people always rely on certain ""languages,"" which, like the languages we speak, allow them to articulate and communicate an infinite variety of designs within a forma system which gives them coherence. This book provides a language of this kind. It will enable a person to make a design for almost any kind of building, or any part of the built environment. ""Patterns,"" the units of this language, are answers to design problems (How high should a window sill be? How many stories should a building have? How much space in a neighborhood should be devoted to grass and trees?). More than 250 of the patterns in this pattern language are given: each consists of a problem statement, a discussion of the problem with an illustration, and a solution. As the authors say in their introduction, many of the patterns are archetypal, so deeply rooted in the nature of things that it seemly likely that they will be a part of human nature, and human action, as much in five hundred years as they are today.",['Christopher Alexander'],Oxford University Press,2018-09-20,['Architecture'],0121449203,A2RWED9VCBM7AZ,0/0,5.0,1316995200,Thoughts about it all,"Book was neatly packaged, undamaged, no/little writing, highlighting, etc. It arrived at a descent time frame after order was processed.",2018,en
Wickett's Remedy: A Novel,"The triumphant follow-up to the bestselling Bee Season, Wickett’s Remedy is an epic but intimate novel about a young Irish-American woman facing down tragedy during the Great Flu epidemic of 1918. Wickett’s Remedy leads us back to Boston in the early part of the 20th century and into the world of Lydia, an Irish-American shop girl yearning for a grander world than the cramped confines of South Boston. She seems to be well on her way to the life she has dreamed of when she marries Henry Wickett, a shy medical student and the scion of a Boston Brahmin family. Soon after their wedding, however, Henry shocks Lydia by quitting medical school and creating a mail-order patent medicine called Wickett’s Remedy. And then just as the enterprise is getting off the ground, the Spanish Influenza epidemic of 1918 begins its deadly sweep across the world, drastically changing their lives. In a world turned almost unrecognizable by swift and sudden tragedy, Lydia finds herself working as a nurse in an experimental ward dedicated to understanding the raging epidemic — through the use of human subjects. Meanwhile, we follow the fate of Henry’s beloved Wickett’s Remedy as his one-time business partner steals the recipe and transforms it into QD Soda, a wildly popular soft drink. Based on years of research and evoking actual events, Wickett’s Remedy perfectly captures the texture of the times and brings a colourful cast of characters vividly to life, including a sad and funny chorus of the dead. With wit and dexterity, Goldberg has fashioned a novel that is both charming and grand. Wickett’s Remedy announces her arrival as a major novelist. South Boston belonged to Lydia as profoundly and wordlessly as her thimble finger. Her knowledge of its streets was more complete than any atlas, her mental maps reflecting changes that occurred from season to season, day to day, and hour to hour. Each time she left 28 D Street — one among a row of identical triple-decker houses, the tenements lining the street like so many stained teeth — her route reflected this internal almanac. . . . For ten years this was enough. Then in fifth grade, Lydia saw a city map and realized her entire world was a mitten dangling from Boston’s sleeve. Across the bridge lay Washington Street — the longest street in all New England — which began like any other but then continued north, a single determined thread of cobblestone that wove itself through every town from Boston to Providence. Once Lydia saw Washington Street she knew she could not allow it to exist without her. —excerpt from Wickett's Remedy",['Myla Goldberg'],Anchor Canada,2012-02-01,['Fiction'],0739322311,A47OMJ8WC34JS,16/17,5.0,1130198400,just wonderful,"Wickett's rememedy is awkward and weird and perfect. It's ridiculous and sad and so very engaging. Another reviewer complained that the cosmic perspective of the novel dwarfed Lydia Wickett's experiences, and I think that's exactly right, and just as it should be. The novel isn't really about telling any particular person's story. The novel is much more about how life unfolds senselessly and uncontrollably; how very little is within our control. Stupid decisions work out well, painstaking decisions work terribly. But in the end, everyone ends up in the same place, and every experience is precious. It's deeper and more mature than Bee Season, in which every character was desperately trying to find some greater order in the universe, around which they could form their lives, and that greater order was strongly implied.",2012,en
In Trouble Again: Journey Between the Orinoco and the Amazon,"Redmond O'Hanlon found few experienced adventurers willing to accompany him on his four-month trip up the Orinoco river and across the Amazon Basin. He wondered why... Was it perhaps the fear of contracting dysentery, rabies or river blindness? Or maybe it was a disinclination to meet peckish jaguars, vipers, anacondas and 640-volt electric eels? Surely it couldn’t possibly be reluctance to swim among giant catfish, with their relatively harmless penchant for nipping off a person’s feet? Fortunately, an old friend volunteered, having absolutely no idea what he was letting himself in for. But then O’Hanlon didn’t have much idea either.

This account of his river adventures in Venezuela &quot;between the Orinoco and the Amazon&quot; is made witty by his dry English humor. I particularly liked the thin thread of his dreams of being back as a child rowing on the River Avon with his father and discovering natural history there - an unexpected, but fitting, contrast to the overtly perilous and ungentle places he's visiting. He has a habit of checking out of the interpersonal conflict by describing the wildlife (esp. birds). Unlike Tim Flannery (in Throwim Way Leg), this is boringly written, confined mostly to physical descriptions and comparisons with the data in his 19th century guide books. He likes to dramatize, humorously, the danger in the adventure, though I wonder if this isn't really a cover for his lack of understanding of the people around him. I found the conflicts with Simon (his nightclub manager, cockney friend from &quot;civilization&quot;) and the other guides most interesting. Also promising were the interactions with the Yanomami, though Redmond is nowhere near as perceptive or penetrating as Flannery is with the Papua New Guinea tribes. I came away from the book feeling that he might have missed the point of the people he was with and the Yanomami, but that he found a gentle, unassuming meaning for himself in the modest framework of his childhood.",2012,en

Satires and epistles,"Exuberantly mocking the vices and pretensions of his Roman contemporaries, Horace's Satires are stuffed full of comic vignettes, moral insights, and his pervasive humanity. Boasting famous episodes such as the fable of the town mouse and the country mouse and the grotesque dinner party given by the nouveau-riche Nasidienus, these poems influenced not only contemporaries such as Juvenal, but also English satirists from Ben Jonson to W. H. Auden. In the Epistles, Horace used the form of letters to explore questions of philosophy and how to live a good life. Perhaps the best-known epistle, ""The Art of Poetry"" (Ars poetica), still influences the work of writers today. These new prose translations by John Davie perfectly capture the lively, scurrilous, and frequently hilarious style of the satires, and the warm and engaging persona of the more meditative epistles. Robert Cowan's introduction and notes take account of the latest scholarship, placing Horace's poems within the development of Roman satire, and exploring the themes of philosophy, morality, sex and gender, literary criticism, politics, and patronage. About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.","['Horace,', 'Quintus Horatius Flaccus']",Oxford University Press,2011-04-14,['Literary Collections'],B00087U6N6,A22IV6NFWC8A5C,1/1,3.0,1351814400,Light thoughts on leaden feet,"Satires and Epistles were intended by Horace to dance, but now and then, have a sting in their tail.This translation, compared to several others I've bought from Amazon, has several advantages over them, The translation is a fuller, almost literal, presentation of the Latin. In comparison, the verse translations are more compact. Another advantage is completeness. By and large, what we have of the Satires and Epistles is here. Not so in some other translations.But these ""Satires and Epistles"" translations do not dance. They go on leaden feet. Where a phrase could have some metre, some wings, it is clunky. The Epistles, for example, were written as poetry, light poetry to be sure and using as Horace did, metre rather than rhyme. Horace delighted in metre, in studying the Greek metres and ""being the first"" to find Latin equivalents. The Satires properly translated (as another example) would show his mastery, each being in a different metre.And to be fair Horace is difficult enough in Latin, since some perhaps many of his effects come from juxtapositions of sound and sense, rather than traditional word order.Still---this is clunky. There are better translations but I still refer to this one when I want a full & literal translation. Perhaps this is the best we can do to be close-to-lietral, even though it wrings out the lightness and the laughter that make so many of us dearly love him after 2,000 years.",2011,en
The Daughter,"In the tradition of Gillian Flynn, Tana French, and Ruth Rendell, this compelling and clever psychological thriller spins the harrowing tale of a mother’s obsessive search for her missing daughter. Jenny is a successful family doctor, the mother of three great teenagers, married to a celebrated neurosurgeon. But when her youngest child, fifteen-year-old Naomi, doesn’t come home after her school play, Jenny’s seemingly ideal life begins to crumble. The authorities launch a nationwide search with no success. Naomi has vanished, and her family is broken. As the months pass, the worst-case scenarios—kidnapping, murder—seem less plausible. The trail has gone cold. Yet for a desperate Jenny, the search has barely begun. More than a year after her daughter’s disappearance, she’s still digging for answers—and what she finds disturbs her.

Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The first comprehensive account of the epoch-making Six-Day War, from the author of Ally—now featuring a fiftieth-anniversary retrospective Though it lasted for only six tense days in June, the 1967 Arab-Israeli war never really ended. Every crisis that has ripped through this region in the ensuing decades, from the Yom Kippur War of 1973 to the ongoing intifada, is a direct consequence of those six days of fighting. Writing with a novelist’s command of narrative and a historian’s grasp of fact and motive, Michael B. Oren reconstructs both the lightning-fast action on the battlefields and the political shocks that electrified the world. Extraordinary personalities—Moshe Dayan and Gamal Abdul Nasser, Lyndon Johnson and Alexei Kosygin—rose and toppled from power as a result of this war; borders were redrawn; daring strategies brilliantly succeeded or disastrously failed in a matter of hours. And the balance of power changed—in the Middle East and in the world. A towering work of history and an enthralling human narrative, Six Days of War is the most important book on the Middle East conflict to appear in a generation. Praise for Six Days of War “Powerful . . . A highly readable, even gripping account of the 1967 conflict . . . [Oren] has woven a seamless narrative out of a staggering variety of diplomatic and military strands.”—The New York Times “With a remarkably assured style, Oren elucidates nearly every aspect of the conflict. . . . Oren’s [book] will remain the authoritative chronicle of the war. His achievement as a writer and a historian is awesome.”—The Atlantic Monthly “This is not only the best book so far written on the six-day war, it is likely to remain the best.”—The Washington Post Book World “Phenomenal . . . breathtaking history . . . a profoundly talented writer. . . . This book is not only one of the best books on this critical episode in Middle East history; it’s one of the best-written books I’ve read this year, in any genre.”—The Jerusalem Post “[In] Michael Oren’s richly detailed and lucid account, the familiar story is thrilling once again. . . . What makes this book important is the breadth and depth of the research.”—The New York Times Book Review “A first-rate new account of the conflict.”—The Washington Post “The definitive history of the Six-Day War . . . [Oren’s] narrative is precise but written with great literary flair. In no one else’s study is there more understanding or more surprise.”—Martin Peretz, Publisher, The New Republic “Compelling, perhaps even vital, reading.”—San Jose Mercury News",['Michael B. Oren'],Presidio Press,2017-06-06,['History'],B000NPNIVU,APRU373UYVK2Y,16/20,5.0,1028678400,Remarkable portrait of a conflcit that still haunts us today,"In ""Six Days of War"" Michael Oren has written perhaps the definitive history of one of the key pivot points of the twentieth century. Drawing upon a wealth of first hand sources (including documents from the U.S., U.S.S.R., Israel, Egypt and Jordan) he writes a history that is at the same time thorough and vibrant. Where many historical accounts stumble is the failure to accurately represent irrational and spur of the moment decision-making. That is a complaint that is happily absent in this account, as Oren writes with the urgency of ""Black Hawk Down"" and the comprehensiveness of a Keegan or Tuchman.The subtitle (""June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East"") actually does this book something of a disservice, because 169 of its 327 pages are devoted to explaining the origins of the Arab-Israeli conflict. From its roots in early 20th century Zionism, to the unbearably tense days of the spring of '67, Oren paints a fascinating portrait of the clash of cultures, wills and nations. It bears mentioning here that I found Oren's narrative to be generally very even handed; there are other reviewers who have argued that he is an apologist for Israel, who ignores Arab grievances. Nothing could be further from the truth; on the contrary, it is the frequently and vocally stated ambition of the Arab states to push Israel into the sea that mandates the view of Israel as the victim.Which brings us to one of the great tragedies of this war: the near mind-boggling stupidity of the Arab leaders. Oren discusses in great deal these men, Hussein (to a lesser degree than the others), Nasser, Atef, Assad, etc., who were so concerned with their own political power that they were willing to sacrifice their young men in ill conceived operations that only succeeded in ensuring another generation of bitterness, regret and violence. Their incompetence would be comical if it wasn't so sad; at one point Oren discusses how the Egyptians, who are in full retreat and have been basically obliterated, assure the Syrians that they are marching on Jerusalem. The Syrians, not to be upstaged, respond that they are in route to Tel Aviv; this in spite of the fact that they had sat out the war to that point, and that the escalation only ensured the loss of the Golan to Israel.Which brings us to the next point of tragic-comedy, the U.N. While the game of high stakes poker between the U.S., the Soviets, the Israeli's and the Arab powers makes for fascinating reading, the reader can't help but see the missed opportunities. In particular, U Thant, the Secretary General, comes across as a buffoon who is utterly lacking in both vision and ability. At one point, during the peak of escalations prior to the war, he delays a trip to Egypt by three days so that his horoscope will be favorable for travel. At the same time, many valid proposals from Latin America and other non-aligned nations fall to great power politics, Israeli maneuvering and Arab pride.As for the war itself, Oren does a superb job of capturing the tension of the early days (to borrow from Churchill, it was a near run thing) and the maneuvering of the final hours. Of particular interest was his repeated use of first hand sources from opposite sides to give a full picture of the battles. It was both fascinating and heart wrenching to read the words of a triumphant Israeli, only to have them followed by the bitter words of a Jordanian or Egyptian or Syrian, who fought bravely and honorably only to be abandoned by his superiors. Along the same lines, Oren captures King Hussein of Jordan like no other player in this drama. He paints a picture of a horribly conflicted, but ultimately honorable man, who faces unbearable pressure from all sides. This view is undoubtedly colored by the moderation Hussein underwent in his later years, but in my opinion it is still valid.My only complaint regarding Oren's description of the actual fighting is that he needed significantly more maps. While he does provide maps of the entire theater they present two key problems: 1. they show six days of fighting on one four square inch picture, which can be confusing to say the least, and 2. it is almost impossible to conceptualize the urban combat that took place in Jerusalem without some sort of street map. My only other issues were that I felt Oren was far too easy on the Israeli's for their attack on the U.S.S. Liberty (although I found his description of the events to be accurate, and probably definitive), and that he was too forgiving of a Johnson administration that largely acted behind the scenes. Regardless of other areas of political concern, it is my opinion that within the context of the Middle East, Johnson must be held at least partially responsible for the war, in that he didn't act more overtly to prevent it.Ultimately, ""Six Days of War"" paints a fascinating portrait of the war that still dictates Mid-East negotiations. Oren presents solid evidence that the Arab states, in a gross miscalculation, ratcheted pressure to the point where Israel was forced to act preemptively in order to assure its survival. That said, he is blunt about Israel's diplomatic machinations in an effort to maximize its gains (only after they had realized they would win). I would have liked to have seen the long term implications of the war discussed in greater detail, but it could be argued that falls outside the scope of this work. Nevertheless, this is a thorough, fascinating, look at a war that is not properly appreciated for its historical import. If we are lucky, Oren will write a history of the Yom Kippur War, and further round out or view.",2017,en
THE MASTER AND MARGARITA,"A 50th-anniversary Deluxe Edition of the incomparable 20th-century masterpiece of satire and fantasy, in a newly revised version of the acclaimed Pevear and Volokhonsky translation Nothing in the whole of literature compares with The Master and Margarita.

American born Muslims say it is better because women are (forced to be) modest, and we are wrong here because we dress (by our choice) in revealing clothes sometimes. Green party types also cozy up to Islamic societies, overlooking their glaring oppression of women. I think anyone who glorifies Islam should read this book.Khashoggi goes past this ""mirage"" and describes life for a woman in Islamic society. It describes the confinement of the veil, when she is forced prematurely to wear it after being caught dancing. It describes the feelings of women in polygamous marriages, when her father marries another woman and her mother eventually kills herself. It shows how women have no power over their lives, when her best friend is barely adolescent and married to an old man. It describes her father, a chauvinistic, intolerant man who is an example of how men in Islamic society are brought up. It describes sex in this society- she has just met her husband and is immediately expected to have sex with him. It also mentions laws- to have a case for rape, a woman must have several witnesses, but to have a case for adultery, a man must only have suspicion. Of course it illustrates the severity of laws when her best friend is stoned to death for adultery. It shows a glimpse of homosexuality in Arab countries- a taboo underground full of exploitation, but common because of the severe separation of men and women. (I am not against homosexuality- I am against both sexual repression and exploitation.) It also shows the violence that people are exposed to, when she watches the brutal execution of her friend.The character is a brave, clever woman who finds her way out of this society despite all obstacles. (In America, she meets young people who idealize Islamic countries, but is not at liberty to tell her experience.) This story is from someone who has lived in such a place.

Long Walk to Freedom.,"These memoirs from one of the great leaders of our time are 'essential reading for anyone who wants to understand history - and then go out and change it' Barack Obama The riveting memoirs of the outstanding moral and political leader of our time, Long Walk to Freedom brilliantly re-creates the drama of the experiences that helped shape Nelson Mandela's destiny. Emotive, compelling and uplifting, Long Walk to Freedom is the exhilarating story of an epic life; a story of hardship, resilience and ultimate triumph told with the clarity and eloquence of a born leader.

Unforgettable' Andre Brink",['Nelson Mandela'],Hachette UK,2013-04-25,['Political Science'],B000OU5TOS,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,7/8,5.0,1279929600,A Beautiful Man,"I've always had a great admiration for Nelson Mandela, but have only known the very basics about his life and political career. Whenever I saw him on TV I was always captivated by the man who had ruled a nation, yet seemed so grounded and modest that I could only respect him. I have to admit that up to the point of reading this book I was totally ignorant to the extremities of apartheid in South Africa for which Mr. Mandela had given his entire life to beating. I have now read these wonderful memoirs in their entirety and must say my admiration and respect for the man has increased to a level I genuinely cannot describe. Having an interest in history, this was undoubtedly a book that I had to read at some point, but up until this point I had, in my mind, placed the struggle against apartheid along the same lines as the civil rights movement in the United States; but I have now come to realise that, although there are similarities, there are a lot more differences.One of the most glaring differences between the two, which Mr. Mandela touched upon in his memoirs, was that in the United States the black population were guaranteed equal rights through their constitution but simply had these taken away from them by the racist political elites, whereas in South Africa, there was legislation and laws forbidding equality to the black majority of the country and this helps distinguish very clearly the route Mr. Mandela had to take in beating apartheid. I'm not going to say much about the story itself as it's one to be read and enjoyed first hand, but I will give my impressions on Mr. Mandela which were gained purely from reading his memoirs. I gained the impression that he has always been aware he's not perfect, nor is he one that thinks he's always right. He is a man that shows respect to every person he meets, but he won't shy away from an argument or a battle when he is attacked either verbally or physically. He's a man of reflection and integrity; he will look back on a past decision and say honestly whether it was the right or wrong call of the time. He's a man who has a lot of love and respect for all of his family, political friends and his country. He has given all of his life in the pursuit of freedom for his country, and he deserves out respect for that.He has a remarkable story to tell and it would be a shame if anyone who read this review or at some point had seen this book whilst browsing and skipped past it without even considering what they could learn. I've now an enormous appreciation for the fight which Mr. Mandela put up against the immense oppression of the South African government; and perhaps it has a greater message to send. The message we can all take from this is that, no matter how big the government or how powerful the oppression, the strength of human will and desire can truly overcome any obstacle thrown at it. Mr. Mandela also expresses a very strong message about there being goodness in all of us, no matter how much we try to hide it. He shows compassion towards those who were once his enemies as he realises that they are all good people at heart, and it is him and those like him that must teach those in the world whose job it is to hate, exactly how much better it is to love your enemy.Beautiful life story of a beautiful man.

The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich - 2 Volumes Eastern Press Leather (A History of Nazi Germany),"The legendary CBS news journalist’s selection of iconic World War II radio broadcasts from countries throughout Europe. William L. Shirer was the first journalist hired by CBS to cover World War II in Europe, and he worked there for over a decade as a news broadcaster. This book compiles two and a half years’ worth of wartime broadcasts from Shirer’s time on the ground during World War II. He was with Nazi forces when Hitler invaded Austria and made it a part of Germany under the Anchluss; he was also the first to report back to the United States on the armistice between France and Nazi forces in June of 1940. His daily roundup of news from Paris, Vienna, Berlin, Rome, and London, which documented Nazi Germany and the conditions of countries under invasion and at war, became famous for its gripping urgency. Shirer brought a sense of immediacy to the war for listeners in the United States and worldwide, and his later books, including the seminal Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, became definitive works on World War II history. This collection of Shirer’s radio broadcasts offers all the original suspense and vivid storytelling of the time, bringing World War II to life for a modern audience.",['William L.

Battle At Bull Run: A History of the First Major Campaign of the Civil War,"Two great, untested armies were readying for the first—and what many believed would be the last—major conflict between North and South. On the eve of July 21, 1861, one Northerner wrote: “The sky is perfectly clear, the moon is full and bright, and the air was still as if it were not within a few hours to be disturbed by the roar of cannon and the shouts of contending men.” So optimistic were the people in Washington that a crowd of civilians came from the city with picnic hampers to witness the crushing defeat of the upstart “rebels.” It was, says William C. Davis, “the twilight of America’s innocence,” and the following day the mood would shatter in a battle that confounded the expectations of both sides—the first Battle at Bull Run. William C. Davis has written a compelling and complete account of this landmark conflict. The Battle at Bull Run (or Manassas) is notable for many reasons. It was a surprise victory for the Confederacy, a humiliating defeat for the Union, and the first ominous indication that a long and bloody war was inevitable. It marked the first strategic use of railroads in history, and the first time the horrors of the battle were photographed for the folks back home. It was also a training ground for some of America’s most colorful military figures: P.G.T. Beauregard, Joe Johnston, Irvin McDowell and “Stonewall” Jackson. Drawing from a wealth of material—old letters, journals, memoirs and military records—Davis brings to life a vivid and vital chapter in American history.",['William C.

In the fighting that followed the Union forces lost 2,900 out of the 20,000 men engaged while the Confederates lost 2,000 out of about 17,000 engaged.The first half of the book describes the Union and Confederate forces as they muster their men into the first armies of the Civil War. It continues with an outline of the events' leading up to the battle and gives you a feeling for, and an understanding of, the main characters involved. Future heroes and leaders of the Civil War come to the fore, such men as `Stonewall' Jackson, Jeb Stuart, A.P. Hill, Jubal Early and Joseph E. Johnston for the Confederacy and men like William T. Sherman, Ambrose Burnside and Irvin McDowell for the Union.The final chapters describe the fighting from Blackburn's Ford to the final rout of the Union Forces on the evening of the 21st. The author's description of the intense fighting is gripping and written in such a fluent style that it holds you to the narrative. Although the casualties for this engagement were not significant when compared to those bloody battles that followed you still feel for the individual soldiers who were caught up in this terrible War.This book is an enjoyable and easy to read story and is well presented by a number of photographs taken at the time of the battle or shortly after.

It is a fine stone building that belonged to the De Marques family. The residence was designed for court festivities. During the Revolution, the village priest saved the Chenonceau.During the First World War, the gallery of Chenonceau was used as a hospital for soldiers wounded in the trenches. Then, during the Second World War, it helped to lead many to freedom. The demarcation line that cut France in two followed the Cher. The chateau was in the occupied zone, but the end of its gallery was in the free zone.The ground floor of the Chenonceau chateau is centered around a gallery built over the five-arched bridge that crosses the Cher. Designed as a ballroom, it is approximately 60 meters long. The floor of this gallery is covered with enameled tiles, and it leads to the larger rooms, such as the bedrooms of Francois I and Louis XIII, who was the last king to come to the chateau, and to the drawing room.Diane de Poitiers' bedroom has walls covered with splendid tapestries from Flanders. The Green room belonged to her rival, Catherine de Medicis. The kitchens are in the bridge's piers, which made it possible for foodstuffs to be easily delivered by boat. One can reach the first floor by an Italian inspired straight ramp staircase, which is one of the most original innovations of the chateau.The hall, said to be designed by Catherine Briconnet, leads to 4 rooms, including the bedroom of Cesar de Vendome, the legitimate son of Henri IV, and across from this room is the bedroom of Catherine de Medicis, with a print room richly decorated by Italian Renaissance paintings.On the second floor there is a room that reconstitutes the sepulchral decoration of Louise de Lorraine's bedroom. After the death of her husband Henri III, she came to live at Chenonceau. She took a room and had its walls and ceiling painted black. Louise de Lorraine, dressed in white, according to the royal protocol of mourning, spent the last 11 years of her life in this room.Timeline:1513: Thomas Bohier bought a manor from the Middle Ages from the Marques family, and had it destroyed. Since he was often away at war, he let his wife Catherine Briconnet manage the construction of a magnificent square pavilion1547: It was given as a gift to Diane de Poitiers, lover of King Henri II. It was her idea to build a bridge over the Cher connecting the square pavilion to the opposite bank of the river. She also had the parterres laid out in the Italian style by the gardener of Amboise, Pacello da Mercoliano.1559: Catherine de Medicis, widow of Henri II, took over the chateau after having driven away her rival. She asked the architect Philibert Delorme to build a 2 level gallery on Diane's bridge. Bernard Palissy laid out the gardens for her, and she started the construction of the outbuildings.1733: The chateau Chenonceau was purchased by the farmer-general, Dupin. Madame Dupin liked to ""hold salons"". Chenonceau once again had its former splendor and became an important pole of literary activity. The tutor of the Dupin boys was a certain Jean-Jacques Rousseau. It was here that he wrote ""L'Emile"". Much liked by the villagers, Mme Dupin was able to avoid the pillage and destruction of the chateau during the Revolution.1863: Dame Pelouze bought the chateau and spent 10 years restoring it, keeping the chateau from falling into ruins.The estate has belonged to the Menier family, famous chocolate makers, since 1913.",2015,en

It is well put together and explores the elements of the man, South India and Cambridge that led to the &quot;collaboration&quot; which allowed Ramanujan to flourish and be &quot;discovered&quot; by the West. Mathematics and Science is Planetary in scope, whereas cultures and colonialism, idiosyncracies of Universities, constraints of poverty, all in some way deny us the fruits of genius, whom I daresay are &quot;normally&quot; distributed in all populations! Nurture, in the true and fullest sense of the word, allows the light to shine through. Ramanujan's letter to Hardy is a classic! It is the essence of understatement, he may have been uneducated in the purely formal sense, but he was quite aware of the world he was to be reluctantly invited to join. His gifts are rare, his powers abundantly evident, there is no use debating how much longer he may have lived, if both he and Hardy understood the difficulties of a South Indian clerk attempting to live in Cambridge. The collaboration brings into sharp relief, the genarally accepted notion that in most endeavours of man, critical mass, or an informed bouncing wall/mirror brings out the best. Does Hingis give of her best against a weak opponent? Doesn't Michael Jordon reach deep when there is half a minute and five points to score? Would Karpov have ramped up his game had Fischer allowed him a match? Ramanujan may have contributed much more had he survived even two more Summers. As it stands his contribution is so outstanding that his notebooks still give up useful gems to knowledge-hungry post-graduate students. Kanigel's book is a must read for anyone interested in the history of Mathematics, anyone interested in harnessing the powers of genius, the relationships among nature and nurture, genes and culture etc. Good companion reading would include the lives of Richard Feynman, John Maynard Keynes and anything on the Manhattan Project to name but a few.",2016,en

In this fast-paced story about friends and coworkers, V. Anthony Rivers deftly conveys the ugly realities of personal and professional relationships. Demonstrating a deep understanding of people -- their ulterior motives, the emotional baggage they inevitably carry, and of course their issues -- Rivers crafts a novel that is as easy to identify with as it is entertaining.",['V.

I am one of those readers that will pick up a book based on its mention in another author's story. With this book I was reading `Nervous' by Zane when it was mentioned in the story as a great book.I was able to fly through it in a couple of days and enjoyed the time with the story. It's a first-person narrative as told by several characters. This office based story was full of drama. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Avonte` doing all he could to play those women while selfishly climbing to the top. Ina never stopped shocking me with her exploits as she degraded from a business woman to a party girl. Of course, best of all was reading Nakia's relationships with Orlando and Terence. As a guy I was completely floored by how much Orlando continued to accept Nakia's overly defensive nature. The story ended well with a nice neat package conclusion.Although the storyline was entertaining I can only give the story 3 stars. I couldn't get past the disconnected timeline. As you read through the text be prepared for jumps in time that seem to span weeks and/or months. This created some sense that I was watching my favorite show and noticed that I missed a few episodes. I felt that the author had a page limit issue similar to a screenwriter's need to edit the movie down to 90minutes. I would have liked to see more character development, get a chance to see the motivators behind the drama.",2012,en

THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA,"The Phantom of the Opera is a novel by French writer Gaston Leroux. Christine Daaé travels with her father, a famous fiddler, throughout Europe, and plays folk and religious music. When Christine was six years old, her mother died and her father was taken to rural France by a patron, Professor Valerius. While Christine was a child, her father told her many stories about the ""Angel of Music"", who is the personification of musical inspiration. Christine meets and befriends the young Raoul, Viscount of Chagny. One of Christine and Raoul's favourite stories is one of Little Lotte, a girl who is visited by the Angel of Music and possesses a heavenly voice. Christine now lives with ""Mamma"" Valerius, the elderly widow of her father's benefactor. She eventually is given a position in the chorus at the Paris Opera House (Palais Garnier). She begins hearing a beautiful, unearthly voice which sings to her and speaks to her. She believes this must be the Angel of Music and asks him if he is.

Trapped in the Mirror: Adult Children of Narcissists in their Struggle for Self,"In this compelling book, Elan Golomb identifies the crux of the emotional and psychological problems of millions of adults. Simply put, the children of narcissist—offspring of parents whose interest always towered above the most basic needs of their sons and daughters—share a common belief: They believe they do not have the right to exist. The difficulties experienced by adult children of narcissists can manifest themselves in many ways: for examples, physical self-loathing that takes form of overeating, anorexia, or bulimia; a self-destructive streak that causes poor job performance and rocky personal relationships; or a struggle with the self that is perpetuated in the adult's interaction with his or her own children. These dilemmas are both common and correctable, Dr. Golomb tells us. With an empathic blend of scholarship and case studies, along with her own personal narrative of her fight for self, Dr. Golomb plumbs the depths of this problem, revealing its mysterious hold on the affairs of otherwise bright, aware, motivated, and worthy people. Trapped in the Mirror explores. the nature of the paralysis and lack of motivation so many adults feel stress and its role in exacerbating childhood wrongs why do many of our relationships seem to be ""reruns"" of the past how one's body image can be formed by faulty parenting how anger must be acknowledge to be overcome and, most important, how even the most traumatized self can be healed. Rooted in a profoundly humanist traditional approach, and suffused with the benefit of the latest knowledge about intrafamily relationships, Trapped in the Mirror offers more than the average self-help book; it is truly the first self-heal book for millions.","['Elan Golomb, PhD']",Harper Collins,2012-06-19,['Family & Relationships'],0688140718,AQR19L2X1P9OL,9/9,3.0,1325203200,"Excellent for Problem Identification, but Not a Recovery Manual","=Trapped...= is a work of its time. Which is to say, the era of discovery rather than the later era of what to do about it. It is also a view of the problem as much from within, as from outside of, the paradigm. In that regard, it reads much like the flood of codependency books from the decade that preceded it: a lot of identification and recognition, but only limited experimentation with, and sense of efficacy about, the techniques required to resolve the various issues and move outside of what author Tara Brach calls ""the trance.""I scanned the one-, two- and three-star commentaries and found most to represent the all-or-nothing thinking that's at the root of this and most other psychological problems. If the book is not all good, it's all bad. Which is far from the case. Much as Mellody Beattie's early work on codependency edifies the problem, Golomb's work here does a truly excellent job of clarifying the dynamics of the sadomasochistic, dominance-and-submission, authoritarian-leader-and-good-little-soldier nature of relationships with self-obsessed, self-righteous, self-involved parents.But Beattie had come from addiction counseling and saw codependency =as= an addiction (it =is=), and suggested the widely used 12 Step approach. Golomb comes from neo-Freudian psychodynamicism, a fine method if one has the time and money, but one that will require a lot of both... and one that does not lend itself to any sort of one-size-fits-all approach, much less bibliotherapy, because the psychodynamic method is so case-specific.Golomb's work recalls Jules Henry's stunning =Pathways to Madness= and Ronald Laing & Aaron Esterson's equally remarkable =Sanity, Madness and the Family=, as well as Donald Jackson's =The Etiology of Schizophrenia=; all from a much earlier time, and all much more clinical. Golomb's approach is a far more reader-friendly (and a lot less upsetting).It is clear that certain, dogmatically rule-bound, religious traditions tend to produce miniature cults of personality like those described by authors Robert J. Lifton, Margaret Thaler Singer, Edgar Schein, Mark Galanter and Kathleen Taylor. Dad and/or Ma are the guru(s); the kids (and often one of the parents) are the supplicant -- and very much =trapped= -- door mats and victims.Having worked with =many= adult children of such families, it is clear to me that the organizational dynamics of cults described by those authors are almost always present to some degree in such families of origin. (Moreover, many cult members were set up to tolerate such cult dynamics by their experiences with narcissistic parents.)I have recommended =Trapped...= to a number of people who found it edifying at their early (usually ""contemplation/consideration"" after moving up from ""denial/pre-contemplation"") stage of recovery. In all cases, it assisted their advance to the ""identification/acceptance"" stage, but did little or nothing to move them on to ""commitment/action."" How could it?Most adult children of narcissistic parents =will= find help in one of the more sophisticated and empirical-research-informed 12 Step programs: Adult Children of Alcoholics / Dysfunctional Families (ACA), which has small AA-like groups throughout North America and Northern Europe.ACA has a recently published book of its own which describes the dynamics in less vivid detail than Golomb's book, but goes on to provide a 12-Step-cum-cognitive-behavioral-therapy approach to recovery. I've seen that method produce results for dozens who dedicated themselves to working through those steps, though many with more severe personality disorders of their own typically require professional help.Many ACA members display mild to moderate symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder including being hypervigilant for narcissistic abuse and primed to hair-trigger fight, flight, freak or freeze responses. I have seen several benefit from the cutting edge treatments like dialectical behavior therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and self-talk identification, questioning and revision.Most counselors and therapists understand that one has to ""meet the patient where the patient is."" If the patient is still in denial/pre-contemplation, he's probably not sitting in your office unless he got a ""nudge from the judge."" But if the patient has begun to wonder why he or she is so anxious, depressed, codependent and/or angry towards a critically judgmental, ego-battering, self-obsessed parent, =Trapped...= looks to me like it can be counted upon to open the door to willingness a bit wider.

I Capture The Castle (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition),"“Every time I meet someone who also loves I Capture the Castle, I know we must be kindred spirits.” —from the new foreword by Jenny Han, the New York Times bestselling author of To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.

Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain and her family may live in a ramshackle old English castle, but that’s about as romantic as her life gets. While her beautiful older sister, Rose, longs to live in a Jane Austen novel, Cassandra knows that meeting an eligible man to marry isn’t in either of their futures when their home is crumbling and they have to sell their furniture for food. So Cassandra instead strives to hone her writing skills in her journals. Until one day when their new landlords move in, which include two (very handsome) sons, and the lives of the Mortmain sisters change forever. Through Cassandra’s sharply funny, yet poignant, journal entries, she chronicles the great changes that take place within the castle’s walls, and her own first descent into love. By the time she pens her final entry, she has “captured the castle” – and the heart of the reader – in one of literature’s most enchanting novels. “This book has one of the most charismatic narrators I've ever met.” —J.K.

As a philosopher, I was quite interested by several chapters (10-15) in which the prince encounters oddball characters on small planets by themselves. There is a subtle philosophical humor in these encounters because the characters engage in actions or have thoughts that are not odd in themselves, but are distinctly odd in the context in which they live, because the thoughts or actions depend for their sense on a context quite different from the one they exist in. The scenarios make for reflection by the reader on questions like what does it take for something to be an ""order"" when there is no convention of obedience? a case of ""admiration"" when there is nothing to compare with? what does it take to ""own"" something beyond simply claiming it? can habits continue to make sense when speeded up from once a day to once a minute? can geography make sense without exploration? I know these are not the parts of the book that appeal to most readers, but they are illustrative of points that Wittgenstein tries to make in his Philosophical Investigations--namely that we misunderstand things when we do not appreciate the importance of their context. This little book was published in 1944, well after Wittgenstein was working on his investigations, but before they were published in 1953. So there is no likelihood of interaction between the two men. Likely their thoughts are completely independent. But it is interesting to me that they approach similar issues in quite different ways.",2015,en

The decade marked a drastic proliferation of books that looked at psychiatry and mental illness but garnered little diagnostic or therapeutic value. Despite the prestige of these publications that usually attuned to academic standard in intellectual circles, none of such literature had the widespread impact of this novel written by Kesey who worked the graveyard shift at a mental hospital in Menlo Park, California. He participated in government-sponsored drug experiments during his employment with this hospital and became sympathetic to the patients and began to seriously question the boundaries that had been created between the sane and the insane.ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is an unforgettable story of a mental ward in which the despotic Nurse Ratched reigns over the doctor and all the inhabitants. She exercises a somewhat cultic tactics to render her patients completely submissive. In what she embellishes a Therapeutic Community, an outwardly democratic entity run by patients, she imperceptibly manipulates them into grilling each other as if they are criminals. She has over the years has welded an insurmountable power over the ward that even the doctor is rendered frightened, desperate and ineffectual. She has no need to accuse or to enforce obedience because all it takes to maintain that tight grip of power is insinuation, which allows her to force the trembling libido out of everyone without an effort.The Nurse's unchallenged tyranny begins to whittle as McMurphy, a 35-year-old Korean veteran who has history of insubordination and street brawls, resolves to oppose her every step of the way and raises the racket in her ward. His defiance is justifiable: he is surprised at how sane everyone is in the ward. Nobody and nothing in life have got much of a hold on this boisterous personality, who knows that there is no better way in the world to aggravate somebody (like the Nurse) who is trying to make it difficult for him than by acting like he is not bothered. McMurphy's fun-loving arrival at the ward brings about a different shade of opinion among the staff and the patients. The latter come following him as if he is their Savior, for he is utterly different and has not let what he looks like run his life one way or the other.ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is narrated by a patient in the ward, a Columbia Indian whom everyone thinks deaf, mute, and unintelligible, but who throughout the years of his commitment has overheard all the trickery of staff meetings. He epitomizes the mishap of the erroneous boundary with which the sane separates them from the insane. McMurphy's arrival and his friendship with the Indian Chief spur him on to recover his own identity and rebuild his self-esteem. The novel examines the notion of madness in the sense of its own and in the sense of the term being patronized by mental institution. The narrator's seamless observation and eagle-eyed description of the ward illustrate salient flaws of such a mindless system that targets only at reducing patients' mental capability. Kesey considers whether madness really means the common practice that confines to a mindless system or the attempt to escape from such a system altogether. Like its audacious protagonist, the novel itself is a literary outlaw.",2016,en

Tom Stoppard: A Life,"A NEW YORK TIMES CRITICS' TOP BOOK OF THE YEAR • One of our most brilliant biographers takes on one of our greatest living playwrights, drawing on a wealth of new materials and on many conversations with him. “An extraordinary record of a vital and evolving artistic life, replete with textured illuminations of the plays and their performances, and shaped by the arc of Stoppard’s exhilarating engagement with the world around him, and of his eventual awakening to his own past.” —Harper's Tom Stoppard is a towering and beloved literary figure. Known for his dizzying narrative inventiveness and intense attention to language, he deftly deploys art, science, history, politics, and philosophy in works that span a remarkable spectrum of literary genres: theater, radio, film, TV, journalism, and fiction. His most acclaimed creations—Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, The Real Thing, Arcadia, The Coast of Utopia, Shakespeare in Love—remain as fresh and moving as when they entranced their first audiences. Born in Czechoslovakia, Stoppard escaped the Nazis with his mother and spent his early years in Singapore and India before arriving in England at age eight. Skipping university, he embarked on a brilliant career, becoming close friends over the years with an astonishing array of writers, actors, directors, musicians, and political figures, from Peter O'Toole, Harold Pinter, and Stephen Spielberg to Mick Jagger and Václav Havel. Having long described himself as a ""bounced Czech,"" Stoppard only learned late in life of his mother's Jewish family and of the relatives he lost to the Holocaust.

Although Harris can be compelling in parts, he allows minor characters to take up loads of space with their banal babbling, while Starling's major nemeses are two-dimensional caricatures. I guess the goal is to make us feel 'alright' with their gruesome ends -we become participatory in their deaths- but they are so ludicrous that they are not particularly interesting (Krendler, Verger, etc). Basically, everyone in the the book is crazy as hell, which sort of takes away from Lecter's monstrosity, making him less interesting. Starling's boring Elektra complex compounds the dullness. Mind-numbing lists of Lecter's effete purchases give the novel a feel of bland inertia. Then some icky guy dies an icky death, and it hardly seems notable.Grammatical errors and typos abound. Apparently Dell editors are either cowards or clueless. Either way they should be fired. Harris' style at the beginning of each chapter is particularly annoying: each introductory being short, hapless fragments in the style of a screenplay. Incomplete sentences simply denote bad writing. He tries to engage the reader as the observer (&quot;Now we are walking up the steps where blah blah blah&quot;) but it all falls flat and the tense gets all screwed up. The narrative is disrupted with such attempts at flair, and the scenes are subsequently poorly constructed. I got the feeling like he was writing this novel in order to make a bundle of the movie, and the fluidity of the prose suffered as a consequence. This makes the flow of the narrative very tedious.The conclusion of the book elevates Starling and Lecter to a mythic inhumanity. It is so melodramatic that you feel as if you have lost all touch with the characters. Harris adores his creations too much, and it kills the story in the end. I give this book two stars because I'm not one of the die-hard fans who has had his hopes and dreams crushed by this silly book; plus the movie managed to be even dumber.",2012,en

O'brian's writing is so entertaining and just plain funny that you'll find you don't mind ten page conversations anymore, you'll positively pray for them. of course you probably won't believe that until you try it, but it is true nonetheless. i think this complaint also stems from people not understanding the author's writing.some people felt that the inter-character relationships were very unbelievable. i have no idea where that one came from. to tell you the truth i was very surprised the first time i read this book that the author, who i then thought to be just another naval writer, was very good at that type of thing.some also thought that the battles were portrayed unrealisticaly, or that there were perhaps minor historical innacuracies to be found which absolutely ruined the entire book for them (i found none) or that none of the characters are easily related to. the battles, i felt were more than enough, especialy with stephen's medical diagnosis of injuries in archaic 18 century-ish which always makes every thing sound more horrifying. as to the historical innaccuracies, the author warns you in his preface that this is a novel, not a history book, and although he has tried to keep within the boundaries of historical records, he has found it neccesary to stray from them in small ways for short times. the only viable complaint i have found is the third and final one, that the characters can be hard to relate to at times. certainly it would help if you are a doctor or an intelligence agent (read the book) or a captain in the royal navy, or play the cello, but i find that even though some of their actions seem to make less sense to me as it does to them, i am fine with it, because the characters feel real, tehy are developed beautifuly, and because this is otherwise such a good book. every one should read it, and the whole aubrey/maturin series.",2011,en

Roosevelt to record the United States's naval efforts during World War II, the author offers the immediacy of events as they unfold, conveying the urgency of planning and preparations, the excitement of battle, exultation over hard-won success, and sorrow for fallen comrades.",['Samuel Eliot Morison'],Naval Inst Press,2011-09-15,['History'],B000OTX8SI,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,0/0,5.0,1326844800,The best book on the greatest naval battle in history!,"This is a very important and very good book on the whole Leyte campaign, which included the greatest naval battle (also named after the island of Leyte) in world history - at least until now. Many previous volumes of admiral Morison's great opus are real jewels (Rising sun in the Pacific, Guadalcanal, Breaking the Bismarck's barrier) but this one is at least as good as them. As one of the other reviewers already stated, this is THE book which gives a clear and precise picture of what happened in all this campaign.The book opens with the heated debate amongst American military leader where to attack after the campaign of Marianas is completed. The discussions started even before the Marianas operation was started, in March 1944 and continued until July. MacArthur wanted that begining in October 1944 all resources USA had in Pacific be concentrated on liberating the Philippines, with the island of Leyte being the first target. General Marshall and Admirals King and Nimitz were initially in favor of bypassing Philippines entirely and going immediately towards Formosa, which move would completely cut Japanese mainland from oil supplies and possibly allow to launch an invasion of Ryukius (especially Okinawa) in early 1945 and the attack on Kyushu in June 1945. Later, an even more daring plan was made, in which both Formosa and Ryukius were to be bypassed and the next stage of war was to attack Kyushu already in the autumn of 1944! The decision had to be made by Roosevelt himself, who in July 1944 sided with MacArthur. Leyte operation was to be launched on 20 October 1944.Before that it was necessary to seize some of Japanese controlled islands close enough to Leyte to provide air cover (once airfields were ready) and advanced logistical bases. This was the reason behind invasions of Morotai (Maluku Islands) and Peleliu (Palau Islands), both launched the same day, 15 September 1944. The extremely bloody, costly and difficult battle of Peleliu, which lasted from 15 September to 25 November 1944 (!) is described in great detail.The next chapter is probably one of the most surprising and interesting in the whole Morison's history, as for the first (and only!) time we can feel author's embarassement in trying to present as a victory an operation which allowed in fact the Japanese to give to the Americans possibly the last ""bloody nose"" in the whole war! Just before the invasion of Leyte was to begin, Admiral Halsey took his fast Task Forces (large aircraft carriers and their screen) for an attack of Japanese airfields on Formosa and Okinawa, to ""thin the herds"" of enemy airplanes susceptible to counter-attack. Those raids, which started on 10 October 1944, produced initially good results, before the Japanese unleashed a devastating counter-strike, which forced Halsey to operate a very difficult fighting retreat. The great air battle of Formosa and Okinawa between 10 and 20 October 1944 left Americans seriously shaken by the fighting capacities and material potential of an enemy which they considered until now as being on the ropes after Marianas campaign. And that was even BEFORE the first kamikazes appeared...Leyte invasion itself and Japanese air raids against the invading forces are described in a very precise and interesting way, but we enter the REAL thing only when the Japanese launched their naval counter-attack. Japanese battle plan was incredibly risky and included completely unexpected elements - and because of an enormous error made by admiral Halsey it mostly worked! Successive fights, which together are called ""Battle of Leyte"" are described here in a very pleasant and in the same time very precise and clear way:- Battle in Palawan Passage (23 October); Japanese heavy cruisers ""Atago"" and ""Maya"" sunk, heavy cruiser ""Takao"" crippled; American submarine USS ""Darter"" sunk- Japanese air attack against Halsey aircraft carriers (morning of 24 October); American light carrier USS ""Princeton"" sunk, light cruiser USS ""Birmingham"" crippled- Air Battle in Sibuyan Sea (all of the day hours 24 October); Japanese super-battleship ""Musashi"" sunk, heavy cruiser ""Myoko"" crippled- Battle of Surigao Strait (night of 24-25 October); Japanese battleships ""Fuso"" and ""Yamashiro"", heavy cruiser ""Mogami"" and 3 destroyers sunk, heavy cruiser ""Nachi"" crippled- Battle of Samar (morning of 25 October - with the FIRST appearance of kamikazes); Japanese heavy cruisers ""Chokai"", ""Chikuma"" and ""Suzuya"" sunk, heavy cruiser ""Kumano"" crippled; American escort carriers USS ""Gambier Bay"" and USS ""St.Lo"", 2 destroyers and 1 destroyer-escort sunk, escort carriers USS ""Kalinin Bay"", USS ""Santee"" and USS ""Suwannee"" crippled- Battle of Cap Engano (25-26 October); the LAST carrier battle in history - until now...; Japanese big carrier ""Zuikaku"", light carriers ""Zuiho"", ""Chitose"" and ""Chiyoda"" and 1 destroyer sunk- American pursuit and mop up operations (25-27 October); Japanese light cruisers ""Abukuma"", ""Kinu"", ""Noshiro"" and ""Tama"" and 5 destroyers sunk, heavy cruiser ""Aoba"" crippledThere never was a more incredible, more tragic and more surprising naval fight in the whole World War II - and there never was a bigger naval battle in the whole human history, if we consider the number of ships, planes and crew members engaged...But then, once this battle was over, next weeks provided some of even more interesting developments, as unexpectedly the Japanese, notwithstanding their defeat in the great battle described above, seized for a time the air supremacy over the Philippines in November and made the Americans pay dearly for every yard of the island of Leyte. Even more incredible, in the narrow seas around Leyte where US Navy would not risk engaging major surface combattants (battleships and cruisers), Japanese destroyers scored again some points in night battles! Those things are little known and I must say that I discovered them only by reading this book. Ultimately Leyte was not secured before February 1945, at a very high price for Americans.But November 1944 crisis finally passed and at Christmas general MacArthur was ready to the next step - the attack against Luzon, the main island of the Philippines. This operation, launched in January 1945, is the topic of the next book of this monumental history.Bottom line, ""Leyte June 1944-January 1945"" by Admiral Morison is a great book and a must for anybody interested in Pacific War.

George Orwell 1984,"""Nineteen Eighty-Four: A Novel"", often published as ""1984"", is a dystopian social science fiction novel by English novelist George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He enters into a forbidden relationship with a colleague, Julia, and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.",['George Orwell'],epubli,2021-01-09,['Fiction'],B000NHNM3C,A3201SGKC2IXYI,2/3,5.0,1025568000,Dark and Bold,"1984 is written in the style of the ""negative utopia.""

Light That Failed (Library Edition),"A landmark book that completely transforms our understanding of the crisis of liberalism, from two pre-eminent intellectuals Why did the West, after winning the Cold War, lose its political balance? In the early 1990s, hopes for the eastward spread of liberal democracy were high. And yet the transformation of Eastern European countries gave rise to a bitter repudiation of liberalism itself, not only there but also back in the heartland of the West. In this brilliant work of political psychology, Ivan Krastev and Stephen Holmes argue that the supposed end of history turned out to be only the beginning of an Age of Imitation. Reckoning with the history of the last thirty years, they show that the most powerful force behind the wave of populist xenophobia that began in Eastern Europe stems from resentment at the post-1989 imperative to become Westernized. Through this prism, the Trump revolution represents an ironic fulfillment of the promise that the nations exiting from communist rule would come to resemble the United States. In a strange twist, Trump has elevated Putin's Russia and Orbán's Hungary into models for the United States. Written by two pre-eminent intellectuals bridging the East/West divide, The Light that Failed is a landmark book that sheds light on the extraordinary history of our Age of Imitation.","['Ivan Krastev', 'Stephen Holmes']",Penguin UK,2019-10-31,['Political Science'],0786175818,ABABCND8BHUXC,1/1,4.0,1322352000,"""Dick's business in life was the study of faces""","Rudyard Kipling was 24 when a shortened version of his first novel THE LIGHT THAT FAILED was published in a Philadelphia literary magazine. It included the ""happy"" ending that the monthly Lippincott's Magazine of Popular Literature and Science had asked Kipling to send in, rather than his also requested alternative ""unhappy"" or ""sad"" ending. Undergoing various revisions until its publication as a book two months later in March 1891 and still later, THE LIGHT THAT FAILED had settled by 1892 into today's longer standard version enjoying Kipling's definitive personal imprimatur. It has 15 chapters and its ending is ""sad"".The novel has depths, dimensions and slants galore: impossible to probe in a short review. Let me just dwell on one of those aspects: LIGHT.A recurring Kipling focal point is simply light: light of many hues, at dawn and at dusk, on the sea and in the desert, as refracted by London fogs; how light is necessary to human life, how its reflections from human faces lead gifted observers like Sherlock Holmes to penetrate behind faces to souls; and, finally, what are light's enemies (not just darkness but gunpowder accidentally discharged by a girl into a boy's face at short range, drifting of that girl's hair in front of that boy's eyes, a saber cut on the grown boy's head in an 1885 Sudan battle, and the ruin that total blindness brings to the life of rising painter Dick Heldar, the +/- 25-year old hero of THE LIGHT THAT FAILED).As early as Chapter Three we learn that ""Dick's business in life was the study of faces"" (Ch. 3). He used this ability cruelly to browbeat the sick unto dying head of the Syndicate that had published Heldar's wartime drawings during the 1885 Sudan campaign, and force the latter to return 247 sketches that the Syndicate had intended to keep. In Chapter One two young orphans who have only each other, Dick and Maisie, are about to part after four years together in a foster home. For Maisie's lawyers are sending her to France to study. She intends to become a painter. What about Dick? About himself he said to Maisie: ""I don't seem to be able to pass any exams, but I can make awful caricatures of the masters. ... I'll be an artist, and I'll do things.""-- Later Dick receives a threatened press attack on his character as an artist by his good friend the Nilghai, corpulent master among war correspondents. Dick merely hints that he might retaliate by sending cartoon sketches of a naked Nilghai to the newspapers. His friend beats an immediate retreat.-- A dejected Dick reads in her face Maisie's lack of reciprocal feeling for him.-- On an evening walk along London's Thames Dick began a ""study of the faces flocking past. Some had death written on their features, and Dick marveled that they could laugh"" (Ch 4).-- When he first lays eyes on starving Bessie Broke in his friend Torpenhow's neighboring flat, he sees in a flash that Bessie will make the perfect model for his planned master painting ""Melancolia."" He says: ""Poor little wretch! Look at that face! There isn't an ounce of immorality in it. Only folly, -- slack, fatuous, feeble, futile folly"" (Ch. 9).Yes, given another ten years, Dick Heldar's hard earned mastery of light and line might have placed him among the immortals of painters, including the very different contemporary French Impressionists. But then something bad happened. Dick's light failed. Estimated by London's greatest oculist to have up to one year more of sight, nonetheless, within weeks of hard drinking while furiously painting, Dick Heldar went totally blind. Immediately, his angry model Bessie poured turpentine on Heldar's ""Melancolia"" and ruined it thoroughly with a knife.To paint, Dick once told Maisie, you must first see something memorable, next remember it even better than when you saw it and finally paint your creative memory. But master paintings require light. And light, alas, can and does fail. There are few sights more pitiable than a blind painter of great talent.

Both were self-made men, both very private, both happily married and both dealt with subjects regarded as (even today) taboo. Both men sensed that the underlying foundation of modern culture were edifices rising from our evolutionary psychology - love, death, sex, religion, power, dreams...the things that make us human.The two were quintessentially Americans, optimistic, willing to tackle difficult and uncomfortable subjects. They recognized the power of the spirit and its overwhelming influence on our very being. Vardis's Testament of Man purposely flows along a Judeo-Christian path. Heinlein alludes both directly (""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Job"") and indirectly (""I will fear no evil"", ""Number of the Beast"") to the world of the spirit.This is yet another of the Lazurus Long series, each quirky and totally unique. We are provided a brilliant soliloquy of eternal life, an old man remembering (and enjoying) his youth. It is almost as if Heinlein had projected himself into the role of Lazurus. He touches on such subjects as religion, incest, love,politics, metaphysics and the joy of being human. The humanity of his writing explains its success and approachability.

"Little women;: Or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","Little Women with a twist: four sisters from a blended family experience the challenges and triumphs of life in NYC in this beautiful full-color graphic novel perfect for fans of Roller Girl and Smile. Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy are having a really tough year: with their father serving in the military overseas, they must work overtime to make ends meet...and each girl is struggling in her own way. Whether it's school woes, health issues, boy troubles, or simply feeling lost, the March sisters all need the same thing: support from each other. Only by coming together--and sharing lots of laughs and tears--will these four young women find the courage to discover who they truly are as individuals...and as a family. Meg is the eldest March, and she has a taste for the finer things in life. She dreams of marrying rich, enjoying fabulous clothes and parties, and leaving her five-floor walk-up apartment behind. Jo pushes her siblings to be true to themselves, yet feels like no one will accept her for who she truly is. Her passion for writing gives her an outlet to feel worthy in the eyes of her friends and family. Beth is the shy sister with a voice begging to be heard. But with a guitar in hand, she finds a courage that inspires her siblings to seize the day and not take life for granted. Amy may be the baby of the family, but she has the biggest personality. Though she loves to fight with her sisters, her tough exterior protects a vulnerable heart that worries about her family's future.",['Rey Terciero'],"Little, Brown Books for Young Readers",2019-02-05,['Juvenile Fiction'],B0006BV75A,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,1/1,5.0,1116547200,"Little women, growing up","Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but ""Little Women"" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of ""Little Women"" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, ""poor little rich boy"" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to ""Little Women."" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- ""scribbling"" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But ""Little Women"" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as ""heartwarming"" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the ""perfect little homemaker"" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.""Little Women"" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement.",2019,en
Lord Of The Horizon,"Since the Turks first shattered the glory of the French crusaders in 1396, the Ottoman Empire has exerted a long, strong pull on Western minds. For six hundred years, the Empire swelled and declined. Islamic, martial, civilized, and tolerant, in three centuries it advanced from the dusty foothills of Anatolia to rule on the Danube and the Nile; at the Empire's height, Indian rajahs and the kings of France beseeched its aid. For the next three hundred years the Empire seemed ready to collapse, a prodigy of survival and decay. Early in the twentieth century it fell. In this dazzling evocation of its power, Jason Goodwin explores how the Ottomans rose and how, against all odds, they lingered on. In the process he unfolds a sequence of mysteries, triumphs, treasures, and terrors unknown to most American readers. This was a place where pillows spoke and birds were fed in the snow; where time itself unfolded at a different rate and clocks were banned; where sounds were different, and even the hyacinths too strong to sniff. Dramatic and passionate, comic and gruesome, Lords of the Horizons is a history, a travel book, and a vision of a lost world all in one.",['Jason Goodwin'],Henry Holt and Company,2014-06-10,['History'],B000DZHEV0,AXR8Y4BLIYXO6,0/0,5.0,1343001600,Old Egypt A wonderful place to live.,It is a wondeful book about the life in old Egypt.

"Woodrow Wilson and Colonel House,: A personality study","Woodrow Wilson’s presidential campaign in 1912 marked the beginning of a remarkable personal and political collaboration between Wilson and Colonel Edward M. House. The book traces the complexities of Wilson’s life and career along with his relationship with House, who for almost a decade was his closest behind-the-scenes advisor and confidant. Through the early years of Wilson’s boyhood, his rise to prominence in the academic world, to the presidency of Princeton University and the governorship of New Jersey, the authors analyze the forces and events that shaped Wilson’s character and his actions in the political arena: Wilson’s first administration, his struggles with Congress, American participation in World War I, the Paris Peace Conference, the formation of the League of Nations, the battle with the Senate over the Versailles Peace Treaty, Wilson’s appeal to the nation, and the eventual collapse of his health and his great dream. “Probably tomorrow’s biographies will continue the present tendency toward raiding the social sciences for new research techniques... The fascinating dual biography of Woodrow Wilson and Colonel House by Alexander and Juliette George shows what can and will be done in this field.” John Garraty, The New York Times “The first completely satisfactory account of this strange relationship... excellent and beautifully written.” — Bernard Brodie, World Politics “Fascinating as a study in human relations, important because of the destiny the two men held in their hands.” — Saturday Review “It has never before been told so well... Highly recommended.” — Newsday “Woodrow Wilson and Colonel House: A Personality Study may be counted among the classics in political psychology... it helped to establish a new methodological standard for psychobiography, signaling a significant step in the discipline’s maturation. Additionally, the Georges’ account has become a resource for a number of scholars, particularly political scientists, interested in a psychological perspective on Wilson or on the presidency itself... Woodrow Wilson and Colonel House has remained over the years a vital part of a number of continuing, substantive scholarly debates on Wilson and on the psychobiographical endeavor generally.” — William Friedman, Political Psychology “[A]n interesting and suggestive biography... two historians have nicely drawn upon psychoanalytic principles without in any way doing an injustice to their own responsibilities” — Robert Coles, The New York Review of Books “It is one of the best attributes of this well-written and interesting volume that the authors have managed to set down, as no one has done so well before, the way in which Colonel House coolly took the measure of Wilson’s personality and undertook to ingratiate himself... [T]he authors are thoroughly aware of the vagaries of human nature. The impression throughout the book is one of careful analysis and insight... There is a refreshing unwillingness, on the part of the authors, to bury their narrative in detail, and hence the high points of Wilson’s career come out clearly, and the judgments are likewise sharp and pointed... All in all, a first-rate volume of history.” — Robert H. Ferrell, The Review of Politics “The authors have done their research thoroughly, have presented their arguments convincingly, and have drawn logical conclusions... [They] are to be congratulated upon a job well done.” — George C. Osborn, The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science “The study is well documented and carefully written. It should have enduring value.” — Rupert N. Richardson, The Southwestern Historical Quarterly “The authors have made a valuable contribution to the literature on Woodrow Wilson and opened new possibilities in historical study.” — J. Chal Vinson, The Georgia Historical Quarterly “A commendable little book which should take high place among the one-volume biographies of Woodrow Wilson. It is a well-balanced, smartly-paced work, maturely organized and presented in an engaging... manner. For the general reader interested in good biography well told, the book should have a special and richly deserved appeal.” — Charles Jellison, The American Historical Review","['Alexander L.

A lot of the material centers on his quests for power, first as an educator and then in politics.Colonel Edward House was one of three people to really become a confidant of Wilson.The sources for the book from Wilson are personal letters he wrote as well as speeches he gave. The personal papers of Edward Mandell House were also used as a source.From reading this book it is evident that Woodrow Wilson had severe personality flaws. His mental health problems in the 1890's were troubling! He was also obsessive in his pursuit of the presidency at the expense of anyone he could utilize to achieve that goal.What I took from the book was that Wilson was a megalomaniac and Edward House was a shrewd political manipulator(until the end of their friendship) that eventually was perceived by Wilson as a threat.On the presidential term, the book focuses on the defeat of the League of Nations which was aided mostly by Wilson's refusal to compromise. The authors also detail the circumstances of the falling out between Wilson and House.This is an excellent book about the psychology of Woodrow Wilson. Not as much attention is spent on House or some of the major changes in the U.S during Wilson's administration, namely the Federal Reserve Act, and Income tax.Overall WOODROW WILSON AND COLONEL HOUSE provides some insight on Woodrow Wilson from childhood to death. This book also addresses some of the politics and politicians of the WWI era.",2019,en
Megabrain,"The classic book that revolutionized the ""mind tech"" industry is finally available in low cost Kindle edition. Scientists have learned more about the brain in the last decade than in all of previous history, and the implications of the latest research are clear: The human brain is far more powerful, and has the potential for immensely greater growth and transformation, than was ever before imagined. These discoveries may constitute the most significant development in learning since the invention of writing. Michael Hutchison captures all the drama, excitement, and adventure as we finally begin to comprehend the most mysterious and complex structure in the universe, the source of human culture, a still untapped reservoir of power and skills. He looks at the recently developed machines and devices that may soon allow us to increase brain size and intelligence; regenerate brain cells; trigger specific brain states such as euphoria, long- and short-term memory, sexual excitement, and creativity; and control the brain's electrical activity in order to alter such ""involuntary"" mechanisms as blood pressure, heart rate, and the secretion of hormones. Megabrain is a lucid and lively account of where the pioneers in brain research are headed -- and where they are taking us.

Moanin' at Midnight: The Life and Times of Howlin' Wolf,"Howlin’ Wolf was a musical giant in every way. He stood six foot three, weighed almost three hundred pounds, wore size sixteen shoes, and poured out his darkest sorrows onstage in a voice like a raging chainsaw. Half a century after his first hits, his sound still terrifies and inspires. Born Chester Burnett in 1910, the Wolf survived a grim childhood and hardscrabble youth as a sharecropper in Mississippi. He began his career playing and singing with the first Delta blues stars for two decades in perilous juke joints. He was present at the birth of rock ’n’ roll in Memphis, where Sam Phillips–who also discovered Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis–called Wolf his “greatest discovery.” He helped develop the sound of electric blues and vied with rival Muddy Waters for the title of king of Chicago blues. He ended his career performing and recording with the world’s most famous rock stars. His passion for music kept him performing–despite devastating physical problems–right up to his death in 1976. There’s never been a comprehensive biography of the Wolf until now. Moanin’ at Midnight is full of startling information about his mysterious early years, surprising and entertaining stories about his decades at the top, and never-before-seen photographs. It strips away all the myths to reveal–at long last–the real-life triumphs and tragedies of this blues titan.","['James Segrest', 'Mark Hoffman']",Pantheon,2012-11-28,['Biography & Autobiography'],1560256834,AUPE71CN3LIF4,10/10,4.0,1144108800,Living the Blues,"This book is without doubt, an excellent, well-researched and detailed account of the life of Howlin' Wolf. The life of the blues pioneer was one of hardship, sadness, and overcoming adversity, and the authors do a good job of conveying what the Wolf dealt with.From his hardscrabble upbringing, an abusive and hypocritical father, and mother lost in psychological and religious madness, and just obstacle after obstacle, the Wolf endured, but sometimes I feel never achieved the full happiness he wanted. There's no doubt he loved his family, cared for his bandmates and did his best, but you could tell the sadness that the blues often heals might not have been enough.There's a good examination here of Wolf's music, his influences and how he managed a signature sound as well as a performance style that blew nearly all the others away. All the same, Wolf was very protective of that sound, demanding of his mates and making sure they did it the way he wanted it done. Sometimes he was overbearing and arrogant, as witnessed by the defection of Hubert Sumlin to the Muddy Waters band. But Hubert later did return, and many would come in and out over the years.The rift between Waters and Wolf is noted here; was there ever really one, beyond the professional rivalry? It does appear that Wolf saw Waters as a company man, in terms of his relationship with the Chess brothers. Wolf was very careful about his money, making sure the brothers paid him what he was due, while Waters was content to allow the brothers to get him a new car or a home now and then, perhaps a bit too trustful.But in the end, it does seem they cared about each other and made up any differences near the end of their lives.I do think there's a certain God-worship by the authors of Wolf. Too much in some places I think, where a writer makes the subject the greatest thing ever, and all others are chaff. Just the same, this is a sometimes funny, often sad look at a great musician, writer and performer, who influenced those who followed, such as the Rolling Stones.When I hear ""Smokestack Lightning"" now, I don't hear it quite the way I once did. It has a more sorrowful quality now than ever. RIP, Wolf...you deserve it.",2012,en

It wasn't the current political environment that drew me to the it, yet it's relevancy can't be denied (I'm a former English major and have been reading some of the classics that my education neglected).That being said, a lot of comparisons can be drawn between Saddam Hussein and ""1984's"" Goldstein (keep in mind I'm no Kerry supporter). I'm not saying Saddam's atrocities are fictitious, but they certainly were embellished to gain the support of the masses for a war the United States is incapable of winning. Now that war is being used by the Bush Administration (read Big Brother) to make a case for its being elected to another term. Or, to paraphrase Dick Cheney, if the other guy gets elected, you might die. I hate Big Brother.The manner in which Orwell gets his point across is a little gimmicky at times (a manual on how the government operates, as well as one on the language), although I doubt many writers could construct a better way of getting across their point. It's not anything that would detract from a five-star rating.",2013,en

Fascinating womanhood,"Over 50 years after the original book became a bestseller and birthed an international women’s movement, the sequel to Helen Andelin’s Fascinating Womanhood is here. Originally published in 1963, Fascinating Womanhood sold over 5 million copies globally and was been translated into 7 languages. As controversial as it was popular, the book also spawned a grassroots movement of classes where women could learn more about feminine influence in relationships and the home—classes that continue to this day in countries including Australia, Brazil, Cameroon, Japan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The sequel Fascinating Womanhood for the Timeless Woman sees Andelin’s daughter, Dixie Andelin Forsyth, pick up her mother’s mantle with the aim of ‘awakening an enlightened form of femininity in women, in order to inspire a noble masculinity in men and create a lifelong romance.’ With teachings that lean strongly on relationship roles—focusing on division of labor between task and relationship leaders—Fascinating Womanhood has also been called “the book feminists love to hate” and there’s no doubt that its sequel is set to raise eyebrows, particularly at a time when gender norms and roles are a hot topic. While some may wonder whether these teachings have relevance within the context of a modern world, Dixie believes they have never been more important. “Fascinating Womanhood for the Timeless Woman holds the position that most cultures have lost the sense of ascendency that comes from proper cultivation of femininity and masculinity in women and men, respectively. We believe that femininity inspires a noble masculinity in men and that it empowers and liberates women to pursue their greatest potential. We teach that women are the ‘gatekeepers of civilization’ and ‘humanity’s original adults.’ We refer to something we call ‘feminine power’ which is unlocked by a ‘fascinating woman,’” Dixie says. In the years before Helen’s passing on June 7, 2009, when it became clear that she would not be able to complete her ambitions of updating the original Fascinating Womanhood book or writing its intended sequel, Helen began preparing Dixie for the task. During that time, she and her mother had broad discussions on the topics to be explored. For Helen, it was a kind of ‘life in review’, while Dixie was a seasoned teacher by this time and had lived the principles nearly her whole life. As much as she was Helen’s lifelong protégée, she was also her mother’s philosophical sparring partner and the result is that the sequel bears Dixie’s mark as much as it does Helen’s. Fascinating Womanhood for the Timeless Woman is not merely a book of personal or moral opinions. It’s based in part on modern science, over 50 years of teaching experience and feedback, and most importantly, results. While Helen’s approach to Fascinating Womanhood began as an academic exercise, with her consulting experts, authors, and other reputable sources in order to add new wisdom to her concepts, it’s evolution came about mostly through a process of application and feedback via the international teaching program. The Fascinating Womanhood blog features dramatic accounts of improved lives and marriages throughout the world. Dixie has used a similar approach with the sequel. While she too drew strongly on her experience and the feedback of the teachers and students, she also expands on new themes that her mother only touched on. With assistance from her husband Dr. Robert D. Forsyth and his research as a licensed psychologist specializing in neuropsychology, her book features pioneering information about the human brain, with a chapter devoted to practical brain architecture for better self-awareness and more effective relationship communication.

Ohio U has a network called CAPA which takes problems from this text, changes the numbers pseudo-randomly for each student, and checks their answers as they enter them over the web.

Little did I know that when I wrote that initial review I would be using this text to teach courses as a TA in graduate school. Looking back, I've come to respect this text quite a lot.

Burney was one of the first professional writers--pre-dating Austen, who modeled ""Pride and Prejudice"" on Evalina. Evalina has more raw attraction and the social criticism is sharper. And funnier when Evalina is constantly driven off course in her romance. This book is about two generations before the Victorians, who tried to push the sex genie back in the bottle by erecting churches, registering prostitutes and punishing them for venereal diseases, sodomy laws, etc. This book is set in a freer, more sexual time--closer to 2009 than 1880 in spirit. Evalina is much closer to Tristam Shandy than to Dickens. And funny. You'll like it. Evalina is long, but it keeps up the pace with incident after incident that can crack you up.

Ten Days That Shook the World,"John Reed, an American journalist and revolutionary writer and a close friend of Lenin and was an eyewitness to the 1917 revolution in Russia. Ten Days That Shook the World is Reed's extraordinary record of that event. Writing in the first flush of revolutionary enthusiasm, he gives a gripping account of the events in Petrograd in November 1917, when Lenin and the Bolsheviks finally seized power. Containing verbatim reports both of speeches by leaders and of the chance comments of bystanders, and set against an idealized backdrop of soldiers, sailors, peasants, and the proletariat uniting to throw off oppression, Reed's account is the product of passionate involvement and remains an unsurpassed classic of reporting. ‘Ten Days That Shook the World’ is a must read for those interested in the socialistic movement and how it shaped Russian history.","['John Reed', 'General Press']",GENERAL PRESS,2020-10-08,['History'],B000PX8ZSQ,A1F6OPXM5LDZ4M,9/13,4.0,994636800,An impressive though biased account of history,"Having just finished John Reed's great work of historical journalism I would call it compelling, articulate, a page-turner, etc. It is unfortunate that Reed died so young and was unable to see what his idealistic heroes set loose upon Russia and later the world. Reed was undoubtedly a good man and I don't mean to discredit his character, just his logic.That aside, this work is fascinating in that it presents so many of the pivotal events in the formation of the Soviet Socialist system from the point of view of someone who was right there while it happened. Add to this the fact that he was an American and thus understood the American sensibility and you have a work of near genius. For the average American reader, this work must have been illuminating for reasons of its style as well as its content.Reed does have obvious bias in favor of the Bolsheviki, indeed Trotsky is portrayed as a demigod, but he is able to sympathetically depict the plight of the nation of Russia near the close of WWI and enlighten the reader to the numerous causes of the Revolution, and why it must have seemed so inevitable and right to those who experienced it.Overall a stunning work of journalism and history, highly worth your time.",2020,en
Fools,"A dazzling new collection of interconnected stories by the National Book Award finalist. When is it wise to be a fool for something? What makes people want to be better than they are?

It a cop out to say that men an women should be held to a different standard. Should a man be willing to overlook his own shortcoming, he's damn well going to look over mine and vice versa. The book touts the idea of leaning on a man for help to show that you need him but if your covering up who you really are to satisfy his/your need for perfection what your really doing is hiding yourself and true feelings from him. It shows a decided lack of trust in your partner and, moreover, their love for you.Conditional love is no kind of love at all and this author seems to think it the best kind their is.

Science of the Gods,"A paradigm-shifting blend of science, religion, and philosophy for agnostic, spiritual-but-not-religious, and scientifically minded readers Many people are fed up with the way traditional religion alienates them: too easily it can perpetuate conflict, vilify science, and undermine reason. Nancy Abrams, a philosopher of science, lawyer, and lifelong atheist, is among them. And yet, when she turned to the recovery community to face a personal struggle, she found that imagining a higher power gave her a new freedom. Intellectually, this was quite surprising. Meanwhile her husband, famed astrophysicist Joel Primack, was helping create a new theory of the universe based on dark matter and dark energy, and Abrams was collaborating with him on two books that put the new scientific picture into a social and political context. She wondered, “Could anything actually exist in this strange new universe that is worthy of the name ‘God?’” In A God That Could Be Real, Abrams explores a radically new way of thinking about God. She dismantles several common assumptions about God and shows why an omniscient, omnipotent God that created the universe and plans what happens is incompatible with science—but that this doesn’t preclude a God that can comfort and empower us. Moving away from traditional arguments for God, Abrams finds something worthy of the name “God” in the new science of emergence: just as a complex ant hill emerges from the collective behavior of individually clueless ants, and just as the global economy emerges from the interactions of billions of individuals’ choices, God, she argues, is an “emergent phenomenon” that arises from the staggering complexity of humanity’s collective aspirations and is in dialogue with every individual. This God did not create the universe—it created the meaning of the universe. It’s not universal—it’s planetary. It can’t change the world, but it helps us change the world. A God that could be real, Abrams shows us, is what humanity needs to inspire us to collectively cooperate to protect our warming planet and create a long-term civilization.",['Nancy Ellen Abrams'],Beacon Press,2015-03-10,['Religion'],0946551871,A141HP4LYPWMSR,0/0,5.0,1147132800,Science And The Supernatural Reconciled?,"'Science of the Gods' by David Ash and Peter Hewitt is a great place to begin if you're a novice in the mysterious and thought provoking universe of quantum physics.

A conversational writing style, consistent pedagogy, and real case profiles provide a realistic context for the scientific findings. This eighth edition highlights groundbreaking updates to research findings and the latest innovations in the treatment of mental disorders.

Used in a large number of college classrooms around the nation, and along with the hefty $100+ price tag, I was rather expectant as I began reading this colorful text that was to offer an introduction to abnormal psychology. And if I might be blunt, after finished the whole text, I'm left with the conclusion that either psychology is one of the emptiest modern ""sciences"" practiced today, or this book fails to achieve its introductory purpose. Due to further research and careful observation of my professor, I surmise the case is more of the former.Pro's: Colorful illustrations, extraordinarily easy to read, interesting side-stories.Con's: Extraordinarily easy to read, lack of depth, constant relapse into the typical unrealized systems of ethics that modern psychology believes itself to avoid.If you're an avid reader, this book will annoy you to no end, but if you have to purchase it for class, than you really have no choice. I wouldn't call this a keeper at the end of the semester, and if you're thinking about picking this one up on the side, you might want to search for a much more affordable book first; it's not as if there's been any revolutions in the field in the last century (other than new drugs, of course).",2018,en
"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","Little Women with a twist: four sisters from a blended family experience the challenges and triumphs of life in NYC in this beautiful full-color graphic novel perfect for fans of Roller Girl and Smile. Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy are having a really tough year: with their father serving in the military overseas, they must work overtime to make ends meet...and each girl is struggling in her own way. Whether it's school woes, health issues, boy troubles, or simply feeling lost, the March sisters all need the same thing: support from each other. Only by coming together--and sharing lots of laughs and tears--will these four young women find the courage to discover who they truly are as individuals...and as a family. Meg is the eldest March, and she has a taste for the finer things in life. She dreams of marrying rich, enjoying fabulous clothes and parties, and leaving her five-floor walk-up apartment behind. Jo pushes her siblings to be true to themselves, yet feels like no one will accept her for who she truly is. Her passion for writing gives her an outlet to feel worthy in the eyes of her friends and family. Beth is the shy sister with a voice begging to be heard. But with a guitar in hand, she finds a courage that inspires her siblings to seize the day and not take life for granted. Amy may be the baby of the family, but she has the biggest personality.

Recently engaged, she convinces her lieutenant fianc&eacute; to let her help him catch the infamous pirate Black Jack Rhys. Dressed as a serving girl in a pub where the pirate is being set up, Lorelei recognizes Rhys as the man she danced with at a society party the night before and immediately fingers him as the man they're after.Jack Rhys had a rough life. His mother was a prostitute (is that a pirating prerequisite?), but he's raised himself up from a cabin boy to be the captain of his own ship. He kidnaps Lorelei in hopes of luring her fianc&eacute; and his father (Jack's nemesis) into a trap.Lorelei isn't just feisty in the wallpaper sense, she really is, and I find it refreshing to see a heroine who is self-possessed and confident. She does come across as a little dim sometimes, but on the whole she's likeable.Jack is a little complicated because of his horrible childhood, but we never really get the satisfaction we need from the build-up of his story because the book ends on a total cop-out.The romance is nice, and I find myself wishing I could see it in a different setting where it would come off as a little more believable. Jack falls hard for Lorelei, and I'm a sucker for a strong guy who is flattened by gut-wrenching love for his gal.One of my biggest problems with this book is Jack's pirate ship, which seems more like a fantasy rendition of a pirate ship than reality. All of the pirates are nice. Some of the men have wives on board. It seems that everyone and their brother has a cabin on their own, and I'm beginning to wonder if this is supposed to be some late eighteenth century cruise ship or something. Let's just say that if you're looking for gritty pirate fare this isn't the place to find it.Overall, &quot;Master of Seduction&quot; is very readable, if a little forgettable. The heroine is cool and the hero is pretty much ok. It gets three stars because it balks at real emotional depth and because the story drags in places, then ends unsatisfactorily.And the cover? Yuck.

In June of 1972 five men carrying electronic recording devices were arrested after having broken into the Democratic Party Headquarters. The five were working for Howard Hunt, who worked for President Nixon in the White House. The authors describe what followed, including their solid journalistic efforts to uncover the truth - and what they found included payoffs, hush money, financial shenanigans, slush funds, conspiracy to commit perjury, political espionage, etc. Their findings didn't prove Nixon's guilt - this book came out before the tape was played that proved Nixon had ordered the cover up and obstructed justice - but the arrows point in Nixon's direction. Ironically, by June of 1972 Nixon was a shoo-in for re-election, and Democratic chairman Larry O'Brien was so open that you'd learn more by speaking with him than by bugging his telephone.This is an excellent narrative as is THE FINAL DAYS which the authors wrote after the facts were out and Nixon had resigned the Presidency in disgrace.

American Way of Death Revisited,"Only the scathing wit and searching intelligence of Jessica Mitford could turn an exposé of the American funeral industry into a book that is at once deadly serious and side-splittingly funny. When first published in 1963, this landmark of investigative journalism became a runaway bestseller and resulted in legislation to protect grieving families from the unscrupulous sales practices of those in ""the dismal trade."" Just before her death in 1996, Mitford thoroughly revised and updated her classic study. The American Way of Death Revisited confronts new trends, including the success of the profession's lobbyists in Washington, inflated cremation costs, the telemarketing of pay-in-advance graves, and the effects of monopolies in a death-care industry now dominated by multinational corporations. With its hard-nosed consumer activism and a satiric vision out of Evelyn Waugh's novel The Loved One, The American Way of Death Revisited will not fail to inform, delight, and disturb.

For me, it matters little what they did because they spent a portion of their life supporting the defense of our freedom. Everyone in the military matters.Even so, those who have faced the rigor of combat have earned an even deeper gratitude. What they face in battle changes their life forever. It can never be the same. An evidence of this is how difficult it is for combat veterans to describe their experience of the war to those of us who have never shared in that experience. The closest most of us get is watching documentaries on The History Channel or reading serious books on the history of the various conflicts that have required so much of our soldiers.This is a wonderful and serious book. Our country has awarded the Medal of Honor, our highest military award, to only about 3,400 recipients since the award was created. Of that number, fewer than 140 are alive today. This book provides portraits of those still living. One page provides a current photograph of each man and another page briefly tells about what was done to merit the award. Each story causes me to shake my head in disbelief. These stories describe acts of selflessness, of duty, of courage that inspire a deep gratitude and admiration for these men and the thousands like them who have passed on.As I turned the pages of this book, I felt I was in a sacred place. I looked at the picture of the young man who became a hero, read the words of his heroism, and then look in the face and eyes of the older man who has lived so long after those acts, and yet I suppose that day is ever with them. I do not know, but from my own life I know that there are certain pivotal events that are never far from the surface.Millions of soldiers have faced combat and each has my gratitude. In know that there are countless acts of service and heroism that are never recognized. Those included in this book are only representative of the heroism so many have shown in combat. To all of them, I say thank you. To each of the men included in this book I also offer my deepest gratitude. Your stories inspire us and provide examples of the highest qualities for future generations.We can all aspire to such selflessness, duty, and courage if and when we are called to face an extreme challenge. It is good to document and remember these acts of heroism even if they are only representative of the truly large number heroes who have served our nation. Those honored here are indeed special men with special stories. As we hold these to our hearts with thanks we also need to think about the millions of stories we do not know and remember them as well.It was wonderful to read about the heroes from World War II and Korea that are still with us. However, I was especially gratified to read about those whose heroic acts were given in Vietnam. It is past time for us to take seriously our neglect of these veterans and realize all that was given in service on our behalf. We owe then a debt and we need to pay it. A first step is to get to know what was done for us and learn the truth instead of simplistic anti-war propaganda.You owe it to yourself to take a tour through this book and think about what these men, and so many like them, were asked to do and what they did to answer that call.",2016,en
Night Train to Rigel,"A secret agent aboard a galactic railroad must derail a sinister conspiracy in this “rip-roaring” thriller by the author of Star Wars: Thrawn (Publishers Weekly). The universe is a dangerous place, a fact violently brought home to Frank Compton for perhaps the thousandth time when a stranger delivering a message dies right in front of him. An operative for Western Alliance Intelligence until his whistle-blowing activities got him fired, Compton is now being sought out by the Spiders, the robotic alien beings responsible for the upkeep and operation of the Quadrail transportation system, which connects the galaxy’s twelve inhabited empires. The discovery of a sinister plot to use the Quadrail for ill has brought the Spiders to Compton—for only someone possessing the former agent’s unique skills can stop the scheme for good. But when Compton leaves Earth behind—joining forces with Bayta, the Spiders’ beautiful, half-human representative aboard the Quadrail—the terrifying scope of a vast, galaxy-wide conspiracy begins to reveal itself. Targeted on all sides by alien assassins of every shape and species, Compton and his enigmatic new partner are suddenly in a race against a clock ticking down to an irreversible doomsday, one in which the galactic night train will derail, carrying all members of humanity screaming to their deaths.

Tim was a fine character - wise beyond his years because the majority of his time was spent with adults who treated him as an equal. His depth of knowledge, range of experience and use of language exceed others of his age. Many will complain that this is a contrivance on the part of Selden, but I was one of those kids and thus it rang true for me. The narrative is fast, funny and enormously entertaining.

Mean Genes: From Sex to Money to Food: Taming Our Primal Instincts,"Short, sassy, and bold, Mean Genes uses a Darwinian lens to examine the issues that most deeply affect our lives: body image, money, addiction, violence, and the endless search for happiness, love, and fidelity. But Burnham and Phelan don't simply describe the connections between our genes and our behavior; they also outline steps that we can take to tame our primal instincts and so improve the quality of our lives. Why do we want (and do) so many things that are bad for us? We vow to lose those extra five pounds, put more money in the bank, and mend neglected relationships, but our attempts often end in failure. Mean Genes reveals that struggles for self-improvement are, in fact, battles against our own genes -- genes that helped our cavewoman and caveman ancestors flourish but that are selfish and out of place in the modern world. Why do we like junk food more than fruit? Why is the road to romance so rocky? Why is happiness so elusive? What drives us into debt?

Wells.There's enough untapped material in the novel to make it rather fresh and interesting and it was a surprisingly good and fun read.In other words, if you liked the movies I think you'll love the original story they were spawned off of and you probably won't find yourself spoiled by much.-Bruce Simmons (BruSimm)",2017,en
The Diviners,"Do you believe there are ghosts and demons and Diviners among us? Evie O'Neill has been exiled from her boring old hometown and shipped off to the bustling streets of New York City--and she is pos-i-tute-ly ecstatic. It's 1926, and New York is filled with speakeasies, Ziegfield girls, and rakish pickpockets. The only catch is that she has to live with her Uncle Will and his unhealthy obsession with the occult. Evie worries he'll discover her darkest secret: a supernatural power that has only brought her trouble so far. But when the police find a murdered girl branded with a cryptic symbol and Will is called to the scene, Evie realizes her gift could help catch a serial killer. As Evie jumps headlong into a dance with a murderer, other stories unfold in the city that never sleeps. A young man named Memphis is caught between two worlds. A chorus girl named Theta is running from her past. A student named Jericho hides a shocking secret. And unknown to all, something dark and evil has awakened....

But the novel speaks for itself, and Demonology had some terrific moments. The Diviners, however, is not a good book. It is horribly, and unnecessarily, impersonal; the characters come this close to caricature, and it commits the worse fictional sin: it is dull. I would never have thought myself to be one day saying that of a Moody story, let alone a novel. But it is what it is. Stylisitically, it is not very complex,and I have no good or bad feelings about the writing style, though it is perfectly predictable. Every chapter gives a bit more forward motion plot-wise, but wrapped in this long-winded diatribe about the moment to moment actions of a character who you don't get to know because all you get are the physical movements, catalogued. This is subjective, but I can't stand novels about society's vacuity. It's been done so many damn times by now, and the writers who do it are either substandard (Bret Easton Ellis) or popular but boring (DeLillo). This novel has no blood, no guts, and the laughs come pretty cheap. $26 is a lot to plunk down as a means to get to sleep. The public library, which provides a great service, has spent their money for you. Go there for this book, if you must.",2012,en
Superstar in a Housedress: The Life and Legend of Jackie Curtis,"A vivacious, rollicking tribute to one-of-a-kind Warhol superstar Jackie Curtis Based on author Craig Highberger’s documentary of the same name, Superstar in a Housedress is a striking oral biography of avant-garde, cross-dressing performer Jackie Curtis. Even among Andy Warhol’s orbit of dramatic personas and colorful characters in the sixties and seventies, Curtis stood out. Whether done up in drag or portraying James Dean—to whom he bore an uncanny resemblance—he dazzled in films, plays, and cabarets. Friends fondly recall how he brought his onstage eccentricities to everyday life, holding court in the backroom of the iconic nightclub Max’s Kansas City wearing tattered thirties housedresses, torn stockings, fabulous wigs, and glittering makeup. Curtis died of a drug overdose in 1985, but not before leaving an indelible mark on New York City’s underground art scene. More than just a performer, Curtis translated his fixation on fame and its trappings into his own poetry and outrageous plays, such as Glamour, Glory and Gold and Vain Victory. With snippets of his work alongside colorful recollections from his friends and acquaintances—including Lily Tomlin, Michael Musto, Holly Woodlawn, Harvey Fierstein, and Paul Morrissey—this is a fitting and touching tribute that evokes the spirited, creative energy that radiated from Jackie Curtis.",['Craig B.

The question is not a simple one, not even to Curtis, an artist who used his own personality and body as an artistic media, reinventing them so often that it became extremely difficult to know exactly who, if indeed any one, existed under the various guises and facades.In a factual sense, Jackie Curtis was John Curtis Holder Jr. (1947-1985.) Raised in a tough area of New York, his father was a sailor, his mother a b-girl, and his grandmother a somewhat notorious bar-owner. Although there is no certainty, it seems very likely that he suffered from several mental issues, most particularly ADD and bi-polar syndrome; whatever the case, he fueled his personality with a mixture of drugs and alcohol and somehow managed to crack the Andy Warhol circle. Warhol had a knack for surrounding himself with extreme personalities, and the hot-house atmosphere suited Holder: in a burst of creativity, he assumed the persona of Jackie Curtis, poet, playwright, singer, actor, and drag queen from absolute hell.SUPERSTAR IN A HOUSEDRESS, a combination of book and DVD, is Craig Highberger's attempt to peel back the various layers of Holder's personality both as a human being and an artist. What he finds is often very unattractive, for both Holder's art and life are reflective of a remarkably extreme lifestyle: the simple truth is that Holder scraped along on a mixture of personal charm, theft, and what might be called disposable sex, never terribly concerned about the damage he caused to others, much less to himself, and prompting a mixture of outrage, pity, and amusement at almost every turn. But while he broke up the contents of friends' homes, he also broke up notions about what art could be. I don't use the comparison lightly, and I do not believe Holder possessed the same degree of talent, but in many respects he calls to mind the French poet Arthur Rimbaud, whose extreme gifts and behavior provoked similar reactions in Europe in the late 1800s.Curiously, the only way to obtain the documentary on DVD is by purchasing the companion book. Both are quite fine--Highberger knows his subject and is remarkably successful in arranging interviews and comments to create a thorough and in-depth overview--but of the two it is really the DVD you want; the book is essentially a supplement.

The Black Dahlia,"LAPD investigators Bucky Bleichart and Lee Blanchard find themselves enthralled with the mysterious and brutal murder of a beautiful young woman, Elizabeth Short. Their obsession takes a dark turn as they delve into the underbelly of Hollywood and the heart of the dead woman’s tortured and twisted past. It is a case that will test their mettle and their sanity. This gripping graphic novel adaptation of the bestselling novel by James Ellroy, The Black Dahlia, delves deeply into one of the most haunting unsolved crimes in American history. Acclaimed storyteller Matz (The Killer) and award-winning filmmaker David Fincher (Gone Girl, Zodiac) worked at length to preserve much of Ellroy's original dialogue while bringing the stark images of 1940s LA to full, living color with illustrator Miles Hyman.",['James Ellroy'],Simon and Schuster,2016-06-07,['Comics & Graphic Novels'],B000KPTZI8,A3WEZ8G9ZYRNU,18/21,5.0,936144000,"Gritty, tough, very intense.","There I was you see, I walked into the book store, the whole place smelled like old moldy books. So I see this old broad behind the counter. Had a couple of miles on her, sort of like me. So I ask her, trying not to sound too stupid, &quot;Do you have any Elway books?&quot; She looked at me, smiled and said &quot;who?&quot;. Elway, you know, wrote L.A.Confidential&quot;. She said &quot;Oh, you mean Ellroy&quot;. She then walks over to the used paper back mystery section and said, &quot;All I have by Ellroy is &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;. It's based on a murder that happened in L.A. a few years ago&quot;. So I picked my brain, thinking, &quot; yeah I read something about this Ellroy guy in the newspaper a couple of years ago&quot;. So I buy the book, looks like it is on its last legs, pages are almost yellow and ready to fall out. I take the thing home, read the back cover, get an idea of the story and start to read it. Then after reading a few pages, I'm hooked. I'm turning page after page, my eyes feel like two hot burning coals. I'm sweating, my brain feels like it's been scooped out, slammed against the wall and it's oozing down like cauliflower mixed with vanilla yogurt. I feel like laying two raw pieces of pork chops alongside my head so I can cool off. I read this book in two days. My whole life came to a stop. Never did have a clue on how it would end; yeah there were little clues here and there, but my little pea-picking brain never picked them up. Now I says to myself, &quot;this Ellroy guy can really write&quot;. Now I'm afraid to read any more of his books. I don't want my life to come to a stop again. I'm an old retired copper, read my share of mysterys in my day, but I've got stuff to do around the house, I can't just read all day. So be aware ! Be prepared when you read this book.

The great Gatsby (Leading English literature library),"A must-have new edition of one of the great American novels--and one of America's most popular--featuring a new introduction by Min Jin Lee, the New York Times bestselling author of Pachinko, and a striking new cover that brings the quintessential novel of the Roaring Twenties into the 2020s A Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition Young, handsome, and fabulously rich, Jay Gatsby seems to have everything. But at his mansion east of New York City, in West Egg, Long Island, where the party never seems to end, he's often alone in the glittering Jazz Age crowd, watching and waiting, as speculation swirls around him--that he's a bootlegger, that he was a German spy during the war, that he even killed a man. As writer Nick Carraway is drawn into this decadent orbit, he begins to see beneath the shimmering surface of the enigmatic Gatsby, for whom one thing will always be out of reach: Nick's cousin, the married Daisy Buchanan, whose house is visible from Gatsby's just across the bay. A brilliant evocation of the Roaring Twenties and a satire of a postwar America obsessed with wealth and status, The Great Gatsby is a novel whose power remains undiminished after a century. This edition, based on scholarship dating back to the novel's first publication in 1925, restores Fitzgerald's masterpiece to the original American classic he envisioned, and features an introduction addressing how gender, race, class, and sexuality complicate the pursuit of the American Dream.",['F.

Don't read this book, or any book, because you believe it to be ""a classic."" That term is essentially meaningless, and the people who use it -- either as praise or blame -- generally don't have any souls. Really. And that is not a subjective opinion.2. Do read this book because, in doing so, you may learn things about the reality of America, the dream of America, dreaming itself and the beautiful emptiness of it, and perhaps even yourself. You may not learn all these things. You may, in fact, not learn any of them. And, frankly, you may not like the way the book is challenging your conception of yourself once you realize just how deeply it is doing so. But at the very least, even if you hate the book after you have read it, you will have exposed yourself to some thoughts that are, in and of themselves, quite beautifully expressed. Worse things can happen to you. And if the worst thing that ever happens to you is that you don't like a book, you'll be luckier than most.3. A lot of people have found in this book something worthwhile, although it hasn't always been (as evidenced by these reviews) ""pleasure."" Some of those people may indeed be fools, and others of them may have been hornswaggled by the Evil American Culture Industry into thinking this book was more meaningful to them than, say, the Iliad. But, probably, the rest of them are just being honest. You might give them the benefit of the doubt.4. Likewise, a lot of people (albeit fewer of them, again as evidenced by these reviews) have found absolutely nothing worthwhile in this book. I encourage you to read their reviews, and then to press the ""read the rest of my reviews button"" to find out just how many of them prefer, say, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (which is, without a doubt, funnier) to this book. But, as in thought number 3 above, it is probably a mistake to generalize: certainly not all of the people who find this book valueless are unsophisticated, imaginationless, anti-intellectual, snobbish, or even just plain douchebags.It is remarkable, however, how often they sound that way.5. You may disregard thought 4 with respect to Luder of Saddam City. I'm pretty sure he/she IS a douchebag. And I reiterate: he/she really doesn't get the book. Or, I suspect, books generally.

Young Hans is a precocious, possibly genius young man from a small one-horse German village. It's a working class town that is known for its steadfast character of its denizens, but not for the scope &amp; breadth of their erudition. Hans is the exception to the rule: he is far &amp; away intellectually superior to his peers, and he knows it.So bright is Hans that he is selected to attend a German monastery to continue his academic studies. So prestigious is this academy that it would be comparable to an American student being accepted to Princeton or Stanford. It is on this journey that we join young Hans; so full of promise as well as a wee bit of arrogance.In some ways, this book could be described as the anti-CATCHER IN THE RYE. Instead of extolling education as something worthwhile as opposed to merely banal, Hesse has a far less flattering view of the educational system. The crux of the book is found in the following passage:&quot;A schoolmaster will prefer to have a couple of dumbheads in his class rather than a single genius, and if you regard it objectively, he is of course right. His task is not to produce extravagant intellects but good Latinists, arithmeticians and sober decent folk.&quot; (99-100)Here it becomes evident that Hesse has little regard for a German pedagogic system which places pragmatism above nourishing persons of exceptional mental acumen. Most of the rest of the book revolves around the nucleus of this passage.The whole tone and style of this book very much reminds me of Thomas Mann. The theme of transition from adolesence to adulthood is present in Mann's works as well. By coincidence, due to the fact that they're both German authors, Mann's &amp; Hesse's books are alongside each other on my bookcase. After reading this novel, I found this arrangement to be all the more fitting. I do know that Mann &amp; Hesse were friends; it appears that they held an influence over each others works as well.This book is highly recommended, particularly to promising high school students who plan on attending college. It engages one of the most horrifying prospects that a serious student faces: flunking out and falling back into the milieu of the blue collar working environment. Of course, working any honest job is a noble endeavor. However, we at once remember the closing paragraph of Schopenhaur's essay ON GENIUS:&quot;A person of high, rare mental gifts, compelled to attend to a merely useful piece of business for which the most ordinary person would be fitted, is like a valuable vase decorated with the most beautiful painting, which is used as a kitchen-pot; and to compare useful men with men of genius is like comparing bricks with diamonds&quot; (Arthur Schopenhaur, PHILOSOPHICAL WRITINGS, p. 97. Trans: E. F. J. Payne)For those of us caught in the middle of Schopenhaur's dichotemy, it is with the greatest strain that we reach for the one, but end up plunging into the other. This is both a consoling and cathartic novel for all the people out there who (like me!) have strived for greatness, but fallen short. When it comes to profoundity, most of us tend to fall beneath the wheel.",2013,en
The Night Stalker: The Life and Crimes of Richard Ramirez,"The definitive account of the notorious California serial killer examines the psychology of a murderer, his crimes, and his cult following Decades after Richard Ramirez left thirteen dead and paralyzed the city of Los Angeles in the 1980s, his name is still synonymous with fear, torture, and sadistic murder. Philip Carlo’s classic The Night Stalker, based on years of meticulous research and extensive interviews with Ramirez, revealed the killer and his horrifying crimes to be even more chilling than anyone could have imagined. From watching his cousin commit murder at age eleven to his nineteen death sentences to the juror who fell in love with him, the story of Ramirez is a bizarre and spellbinding descent into the very heart of human evil. After The Night Stalker was first published, thousands of women from all over the world contacted Carlo, begging to be put in touch with the killer. Carlo interviewed them and presents their disturbing stories in this updated edition along with an exclusive death row interview where the killer himself gives his thoughts on the “Ramirez Groupies” —and what he thinks they really want. Carlo’s interviews with Ramirez are featured in Netflix’s Night Stalker: The Hunt for a Serial Killer. “An astonishing portrait of a killer not seen since In Cold Blood.” —New York Daily News “I couldn’t put the book down . . . very scary indeed.” —Los Angeles Times “An exceptionally well-told true crime tale.” —Publishers Weekly Perfect for true crime readers of I’ll Be Gone in the Dark, Zodiac, and Helter Skelter.

ART AND ANGER: ESSAYS ON POLITICS AND THE IMAGINATION.,"Fascinated by the idea of Western civilization as being a sequence of numerous misinterpretations and misrepresentations, these nineteen essays cover a broad range of topics with the unifying theme being the crossroads where politics and the imagination meet. An essay on linguistics and culture discusses the shaping of Latin America's collective identity; Peru's modern history is approached as a bloody battle between enlightenment and darkness; and in critiques of Octavio Paz and Gabriel García Márquez, Stavans reflects on the dichotomy between pen and sword in the Hispanic world. In 'Letter to a German Friend', Stavans returns to his fate as a Jew in the Southern Hemisphere, and in 'The First Book,' he connects his passion for literature to his initiation into Jewishness. Finally, in a meditation on Columbus's afterlife, he reflects on the many ways in which we reinvent ourselves in order to make sense of the chaotic world that surrounds us.",['I. Stavans'],Springer,2016-04-30,['Science'],B000N7C9BS,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,2/2,3.0,995587200,A problematic but interesting collection of essays,"&quot;Art and Anger: Essays on Politics and the Imagination&quot; is a frequently fascinating, frequently annoying volume of essays by Jewish Mexican writer Ilan Stavans. Stavans, who moved to the United States and writes in English, has a complex perspective which is reflected in this book.Much of this book deals with Latin American literature. Stavans' essays are informative, and frequently rich in intriguing insights. But I often found his style pompous and arrogant. I particularly disliked his many nasty comments about other Latino/Hispanic writers: he calls Mario Vargas Llosa a &quot;dilettante&quot; (in &quot;Two Peruvians&quot;); he dismisses Cherrie Moraga's work as &quot;highly predictable and often stale&quot; (&quot;Art and Anger&quot;); he refers to the career of Gabriel Garcia Marquez as &quot;curiously disappointing,&quot; and says that this author's &quot;Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor&quot; is &quot;forgettable and poorly structured&quot; (&quot;The Master of Aracataca&quot;). Some of his cruelest comments are directed at Octavio Paz, whom he accuses of having a &quot;relentless need to be worshiped and applauded.&quot; I have no doubt that many educated readers will disagree with these and other highly subjective statements.Other essays in the collection are also troublesome. &quot;The Latin Phallus: A Survey&quot; contains interesting comments on such gay Latin American writers as Reinaldo Arenas and Jose Lezama Lima. But the essay as a whole is poorly structured (to steal one of Stavans' phrases) and ultimately unsatisfying.Still, there are many good points in this collection. I was particularly intrigued by &quot;Tongue Snatcher,&quot; about Argentine-born Hector Bianciotti, who writes in his adopted language of French. Overall, I recommend &quot;Art and Anger&quot; to those interested in Latin American studies, but I suggest that it be read with a critical eye.",2016,en
Last Step: The American Ascent of K2,"CLICK HERE to download a sample from The Last Step * A mountaineering classic * Conflict, hardship, endurance, triumph -- it's all here in Ridgeway's extraordinary story In September 1978, Rick Ridgeway, Jim Wickwire, Lou Reichardt and John Roskelley stood atop K2, the first Americans ever to achieve this victory. Under the leadership of Jim Whittaker, they and their teammates had spent 67 days on the mountain, nearly all of them above 18,000 feet, where the stresses of high-altitude living, of monotonous food, of confinement in tiny tents for day after day of frustrating storms had worn them down to the core. The Last Step is Rick Ridgeway's inside story of this extraordinary expedition. It's about the people who, battered by the mountain and their isolation, overcame their individual fears, desire, and disappointments to work together to get somebodyñanybodyñto the top of K2. It's about the glorious success the team achieved, and about the perilous bivouac Jim Wickwire spent just below the summit without food, oxygen or shelter in temperatures of -40F.",['Rick Ridgeway'],Mountaineers Books,2014-02-14,['Sports & Recreation'],0898860075,A3AIYJ7UHGQK1D,2/4,3.0,1198972800,"The ""Me"" Generation Climbs A Mountain","I've spent the past couple of weeks reading a lot of mountaineering books, including the incredible ""High"" and ""Epic"" collections. This book was more interesting from a sociological perspective than an historical one. It should have been titled, ""The Me Generation Climbs a Mountain and Lives (Somehow) to Tell About It.""There is some detail about the actual climb and route(s) chosen, but most of the book is about interpersonal relationships and navel gazing on the part of the author/narrator as well as those who contributed to the book. If this team had been climbing during the 50's, the rest of the mountaineers would have thrown them off a cliff after a week. If they'd been climbing with Messner, he'd have thrown each of them off a cliff. Without oxygen. After the first day. The whining! The arguments! The touchy-feely ""we cleared the air and now everything'll be great!"" attitude.No, really, the previous generation was wiser: keep your feelings to yourself and stifle, stifle, stifle, all the way to the top, because when you have to live with people under very stressful conditions for a long time, even small things get magnified into major issues; and this group started out with HUGE things.Some of the attitudes displayed were also condescending. The author thinks little of the Japanese conquest of K2, and makes a snide remark early on about how he has no doubt they will find lots of Japanese trash on the mountain left over from the huge Japanese expedition. As the book wends on, oddly enough, he finds loads of Polish trash and rope left, even excavating what he terms a ""garbage dump."" But the only Japanese trash he finds on the mountain is a soup wrapper! I don't think, in all his navel-gazing, he realised how disrespectful and denigrating he came across, because I'm sure he'd have beaten his breast over that too.The epilogue was very satisfying: after the temper tantrum thrown by one of the climbers, it was interesting to read about karmic retribution, if you will. But I'd pick up Ed Hillary's book to reread (again) before I'd read this book again. Edmund Hillary actually seems to enjoy climbing mountains, and is able to convey the wonder and excitement he felt climbing even ""small"" peaks in the Himalayas.PS: My husband points out that the book has a magnificent collection of photographs.

Moments of Reprieve: A Memoir of Auschwitz,"In this collection of essays based on his time as a Jewish prisoner in the Nazi camps, Primo Levi creates a series of sketches of the people he met who retained their humanity even in the most inhumane circumstances. Having already written two memoirs of his survival at Auschwitz, Levi knew there was still more left untold. Collected in this book are stray vignettes of fifteen individuals Levi met during his imprisonment. Whether it was the young Romani man who smuggled a creased photo of his bride past the camp guards or the starving prisoner who still insisted on fasting on Yom Kippur, the memory of these individuals stayed with Levi for long after. They represent for him “bizarre, marginal moments of reprieve.” Neither simple heroes nor victims, but people who never lost sight of their humanity in the face of unimaginable suffering. Written with the author’s signature humility and intelligence, Moments of Reprieve shines with lyricism and insight. Nearly forty years after their publication, Levi’s words remain as beautiful as they are necessary. Along with Elie Wiesel and Hannah Arendt, Primo Levi is remembered as one of the most powerful and perceptive writers on the Holocaust and the Jewish experience during World War II. This is an essential book both for students and literary readers.

Patterns in Nature,"The acclaimed science writer “curates a visually striking, riotously colorful photographic display…of physical patterns in the natural world” (Publishers Weekly, starred review). Though at first glance the natural world may appear overwhelming in its diversity and complexity, there are regularities running through it, from the hexagons of a honeycomb to the spirals of a seashell and the branching veins of a leaf. Revealing the order at the foundation of the seemingly chaotic natural world, Patterns in Nature explores not only the math and science but also the beauty and artistry behind nature’s awe-inspiring designs. Unlike the patterns we create, natural patterns are formed spontaneously from the forces that act in the physical world. Very often the same types of pattern and form—such as spirals, stripes, branches, and fractals—recur in places that seem to have nothing in common, as when the markings of a zebra mimic the ripples in windblown sand. But many of these patterns can be described using the same mathematical and physical principles, giving a surprising unity to the kaleidoscope of the natural world. Richly illustrated with 250 color photographs and anchored by accessible and insightful chapters by esteemed science writer Philip Ball, Patterns in Nature reveals the organization at work in vast and ancient forests, powerful rivers, massing clouds, and coastlines carved out by the sea. By exploring similarities such as the branches of a tree and those of a river network, this spectacular visual tour conveys the wonder, beauty, and richness of natural pattern formation.",['Philip Ball'],University of Chicago Press,2016-04-05,['Photography'],0316813281,A2IGEZZ9167712,2/2,5.0,1272240000,Patterns in Nature by Peter Stevens,"This is a book I read back in the early 80's and lost track of it.

Review,"The `captive' of the title is Elinor Brinton, a poor little rich girl, whose loveless childhood has made her both misanthropic and misogynistic. Despite her unfortunate childhood, her self-regard is huge: she considers herself brilliant and the rest of humanity more or less witless. Although psychologically repugnant, she is beautiful enough, physically, to attract the attention of white slavers who abduct her and take her to the planet, Gor, where women of her beauty are likely to be made sex slaves and sold to the highest bidder. This fate falls to Elinor: under the threat of the lash or worse she is trained to be submissive to the dominant men who purchase and dominate her. She learns, perhaps paradoxically that being beaten by a man is an expression of his regard and comes to believe that the chains in which she is kept and the constant humiliations to which she is subject are no more than the biological due owed to the sexual dimorphism of human beings, the enslavement of the physically weaker sex being held up as the ideal for managing a human society. Eventually Elinor comes to understand how loathsome her behaviour once was and how much more decent a person the regime of humiliation and punishment has made of her. She falls in love with the excessively alpha male who has captured and tortured her. Although subject to some strange neoligisms invention of the author's the novel is beautifully written and, as one might expect from the pen of a professor of Philosophy, the `politically incorrect' philosophical underpinnings carry surprising conviction. A book to calculated to make the repressed male of Earth smile wryly and the frigid Earth female shrug with resignation. I imagine man-hating feminists who are able to find their way past the cover design would read it with self-righteous indignation.",2014,en

The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the End of History,"The Shape of the Signifier is a critique of recent theory--primarily literary but also cultural and political. Bringing together previously unconnected strands of Michaels's thought--from ""Against Theory"" to Our America--it anatomizes what's fundamentally at stake when we think of literature in terms of the experience of the reader rather than the intention of the author, and when we substitute the question of who people are for the question of what they believe. With signature virtuosity, Michaels shows how the replacement of ideological difference (we believe different things) with identitarian difference (we speak different languages, we have different bodies and different histories) organizes the thinking of writers from Richard Rorty to Octavia Butler to Samuel Huntington to Kathy Acker. He then examines how this shift produces the narrative logic of texts ranging from Toni Morrison's Beloved to Michael Hardt and Toni Negri's Empire.

This book is more or less about the difference between the two.There's a whole genre of books out there where civilization doesn't end in a blazing hail of fire, but with a more sobering whimper as society gently crumbles around itself and everyone who is left in the pieces have to figure out how best to use the time remaining to them, because putting things back to how they were won't be an option. Aldiss, being British, can't help but sprinkle his work with a certain melancholy that skirts just shy of full blown ""On the Beach"" style depression. It's something about the country that infuses their science-fiction with an elegant weariness, like falling asleep after walking for miles in the snow. Sure, it will kill you, but after all that effort sometimes it's just a relief to stop.""Greybeard"" takes us into a fairly unique scenario . . . the whole adult population of earth gets sterilized. There's an accident up in the atmosphere and suddenly nobody is getting pregnant anymore. Not a problem, the human race figures. Whatever this is will probably wear off and we'll get back to making babies and filling every corner of the planet in no time.Fast forward a few decades and clearly that hasn't happened. The Earth has basically become one big nursing home, as the youngest people on the planet are now in their fifties, and not getting younger. Suddenly everyone in the world is an AARP member and having to face the inevitable . . . once they're gone, that's it.This could have been played for laughs, and early scenes do toy with the utter absurdity of old people fighting each other and a population trying to scrape out a living in the ruins of civilization while also worrying about hearing loss and whether they have enough fiber in their diet. Greybeard is young enough to not have these problems yet, but he's also been around long enough to know this is the way the world is going, and when he reaches the age of these people, who is going to be around to take care of him? So, feeling the threat of stagnation breathing around his neck, he and his wife go exploring, to try to find a life that might be different. That might not be ossifying into a slow fade out.But Aldiss does an interesting thing here, which is show us where these people have wound up and then take us back to depict how they started to get here in the first place, the gradual breaking down of the world that results when no one new comes to take the place of the people who are turning gray. It's in the little touches, the minor breakdowns that warn us about the end and wind up being catastrophic. The ones we never really see coming. It's the toy companies that are the canaries in the coal mine . . . when no one young in existence, there's no one around to buy toys. Not every disaster comes with a mushroom cloud. And more and more as we sink our way into a history that is striving toward a point where history will no longer exist, we realize the story is about absence, decay turning into renewal and what it leaves behind. Society adapting to what is no longer there, everyone coming up against impossible situations, staring the wall in the face and deciding to make camp there in order to make the best of it. People make little adjustments at first, as the population shrinks, as everyone gets older. A tweak here, a change there and it's not until years pass that anyone can take stock and see how much has changed. That's how society works in the novel, the greatest changes don't come sweeping, but creep up on us until one day it's just how things always are. Like the first day you find a gray hair, and realize there's really no turning back now.I wish I could say the book is about how Greybeard and his wife begin to rebuild civilization, how mankind starts to scratch its way back up to dominance. But it's not about that and that's fine There's a calm elegance in seeing England going back to its wild roots, trees and forests taking over towns, Richard Jefferies ""Wild England"" finally coming true. No one is happy about this, but everyone accepts it because what else can you do? Mankind is done and it's all over but the aging, so instead we watch Greybeard play observer to a history that won't matter anymore because no one will be around to remember it. It's not a story about winning or succeeding, but persisting and accepting, about finally realizing that you can find a place for yourself in the midst of the collapse. The clock of nature turns back while the age of everyone constantly turns forward and there's a haunting quality as we leapfrog from the days when everyone could remember what young was, to steps toward the final graying, where old-timers shuffle through the disintegrating ruins of the majesties they once created, the towers growing more vine-covered and fading with each new day. But what good is making your mark upon the world, if there's no one left to be impressed?Maybe the only answer really is a sigh, but there's some dignity in that, too, and in the quiet lives of these characters, and in this world, growing younger even as the years plod on.",2014,en

And for seven years he's been at large, free to savor the scents, the essences, of an unguarded world. But intruders have entered Dr. Lecter's world, piercing his new identity, sensing the evil that surrounds him. For the multimillionaire Hannibal left maimed, for a corrupt Italian policeman, and for FBI agent Clarice Starling, who once stood before Lecter and who has never been the same, the final hunt for Hannibal Lecter has begun.

We probably can't just 'look' at stuff, we need to make (useful) predictions or the theory won't last. The interested reader should also pick up, if briefly, Mandelbrot's Fractal Geometry of Nature.Two notes of interest. 1) Morphology has indeed proven successful in proving physical theory: in the aggregation of dust particals, measuring the gross fractal dimension allows you to predict the type of noise involved in creating it. 2) The logarithmic spiral, together with the fibonnaci sequence and the golden ratio, show up quite surprisingly in synchronized chaotic loops.PS: to these I can add three more. 3) Shipman and Newell at the University of Arizona have shown that the Fibonnaci sequence in phylotaxis arises from buckling of pressurized skin (e.g. in a cactus or young sunflower) 4) Goldstein, also at UA, has shown that a broad variety of cave patterns (from ripples on the wall to bumps on stalagtites to wonderful crystaline snowflakes) all arise as a result of a single cause, the diffusion-reaction equation. 5) the late Winfree (also at UA!) has quite conclusively shown that heart beating and defribrillation are non-equilibrium sprial patterns similar to the BZ reaction.The whole business of form has been taken up by the Sante Fe institute, see Kauffman's At Home in the Universe.

The Reader over your Shoulder: A Handbook for Writers of English Prose,"In late October 1939, Robert Graves wrote to Alan Hodge: “I have begun a new book, about English.” Graves and Hodge had recently completed a social history of the between-wars period called The Long Week-End. Now they embarked on this new project, “a handbook for writers of English Prose,” to be called The Reader Over Your Shoulder. The world was in total upheaval. Graves had already fled Majorca three years earlier at the start of the Spanish Civil War. As they labored over their new writing project, Graves and Hodge witnessed the fall of France and the evacuation of Allied forces at Dunkirk. In early September 1940 began the bombing of London by the German Luftwaffe, a concentrated effort to destroy the resolve of the English people. Graves’s and Hodge’s idea was simple enough: at a time when their whole world was falling apart, the survival of English prose sentences, of writing that was clear, concise, intelligible, had become paramount if hope were going to survive the onslaught. They came up with forty-one principles for writing, the majority devoted to clarity, the remainder to grace of expression. They studied the prose of a wide range of noted authors and leaders, finding much room for improvement. Quoting grammarian and bestselling author Patricia T. O’Conner from her new introduction, “With a new war to be won, the kingdom couldn’t afford careless, sloppy English. Good communication was critical.” The book they would write would turn out to be one of the most erudite, and at the same time one of the most spontaneous and inspired, ever to take on the challenge of writing well. O’Conner in her introduction describes The Reader Over Your Shoulder as nothing less than “the best book on writing ever published.” The present edition restores, for the first time in three-quarters of a century, the original, 1943, text, which in subsequent printings and editions had been shortened by over 150 pages, including much of the heart of the book.","['Robert Graves', 'Alan Hodge']",Seven Stories Press,2018-01-09,['Language Arts & Disciplines'],B0006AQ3M8,A1V4MPABJARJOK,11/23,2.0,1049500800,The pot over the shoulder of the kettle. (Or something.),"I just don't know about this book. ... I got it out of library, started reading it and came across this passage:""For example: 'Everyone this autumn is wearing amusing antelope-skin gloves.' This may have been true in 1934 of every woman, or almost every woman, of a certain income level in certain London districts; elsewhere it was demonstrably untrue. Fashion notes of this sort ... historians will find them most misleading.""Are these guys for real? Two distinguished authors, one a professor of English literature, apparently totally missing the point and purpose of ""Fashion notes"". It hardly needs to be said that historians are probably the last people for whom these fashion notes are written, at least if my own experience of historians' dress-sense is anything to go by.And then there's this example from a letter by an evacuee girl in the second world war:""'The old cat was on to me yesterday about being careful with my crusts. I bet she's careful enough with hers, the old ... I don't suppose she'd give one to a beggar-child, not if it was starving. I must waste not and want not and put everything in the savings bank ... I must bow down to her as if she was a little tin image. I must get out of this place before I go potty.'""Here is Graves and Hodge's analysis:""Great care must be taken to let the reader know just when the ironical note is sounded and just when it ceases ... The three 'I must's here are not parallel. The first is the reported advice of the Old Cat; the second is the writer's ironical deduction...; the third is the writer's practical decision, given without irony.""Now, what exactly do Graves and Hodge intend by presenting this example? Are they saying that the girl's letter does NOT make it clear when she's being ironic? Coz frankly I think it's stunningly clear. To anyone. I think it's a remarkably well written letter, lucid and eloquent -- which is why Graves and Hodge were so easily able to explain the precise function of each 'I must' in the first place.Graves and Hodge have themselves been guilty of a lack of clarity here -- are they criticising the letter or not? -- and for a book about good style in written English this is unforgivable.",2018,en

Driven by nothing but money and time and either their addiction to it or their subsequent aversion to it. If they are adverse they are outcast and looked to be nothing but a shameful blight upon the family itself.There are also tenuous struggles between race which was typical for Faulkner's time period.

An unlikely pair, George and Lennie, two migrant workers in California during the Great Depression, grasp for their American Dream. Laborers in California's dusty vegetable fields, they hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. For George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. When they land jobs on a ranch in the Salinas Valley, the fulfillment of their dream seems to be within their grasp. But even George cannot guard Lennie from the provocations, nor predict the consequences of Lennie's unswerving obedience to the things George taught him.

The short novel features two runaways who find a job on a northern California farm bucking barley. The simple plot entrances the reader who is trying to figure out how it will finish.Steinbeck creates two grown men who contrast almost entirely. First there's George, a short, squat, shart middle-aged man who has a sort of leader type personality. Enter Lennie, a giant of a man who has some sort of mental disease that renders him a &quot;dumb dumb.&quot; The two seem to create a famous mobster par, with George as the headman and Lennie as his big sidekick/bodyguard.The two men were forced to leave their previous jobs and residence because of a mistake on Lennie's part. The two soon find a job on a farm along with a supporting cast of interesting characters whose personalities are exquisitly described by Steinbeck. George and Lennie are forced to scrimp and save their money from their bare minimum jobs in hopes of someday fulfilling their dream of buying a farm of their own.Capitalizing on Lennie's mind, Steinbeck reates an out-of-the-blue plot twist at the end that reflects Steinbeck's book writing brilliance.

Kushiel's Dart,"Fifty Shades of Grey meets Game of Thrones, Kushiel's Dart is the first in a triptych of beautifully constructed historical fantasies that combine passion, danger, great battles, and deep eroticism. The land of Terre d’Ange is a place of unsurpassing beauty and grace. It is said that the angels found the land and saw it was good... and the ensuing race that rose from the seed of angels and men live by one simple rule: Love as thou wilt. Phèdre nó Delaunay is a young woman who was born with a scarlet mote in her left eye and sold into indentured servitude as a child. Her bond is purchased by Anafiel Delaunay, a nobleman with a very special mission... and the first one to recognize who and what she is: one pricked by Kushiel’s Dart, chosen to forever experience pain and pleasure as one. Phèdre is trained equally in the courtly arts and the talents of the bedchamber, but, above all, in the ability to observe, remember, and analyze. Almost as talented a spy as she is a courtesan, Phèdre stumbles upon a plot that threatens the very foundation of her homeland. Treachery sets her on her path; love and honor goad her further and will take her to the edge of despair... and beyond. Hateful friend, loving enemy, beloved assassin; they can all wear the same glittering mask in this world, and Phèdre will get but one chance to save all that she holds dear. Set in a world of cunning poets, deadly courtiers, heroic traitors, and a truly Machiavellian villainess, this is a novel of grandeur, luxuriance, sacrifice, betrayal, and deeply laid conspiracies.

There is travel, love, betrayals, unexpected enemies and friends, and a few situations where magical qualities are displayed; but my favorite scenes were those of the battles and escapes. You should also be aware that there are some very intense, sexually explicit encounters in these books.All in all, I enjoyed this trilogy very much; while not deep or philosophical it was easy to read and found myself looking forward to finding time to return to these books when the opportunity arose.

In this, Yinshun not only re-asserted the fundamentals of Buddhist tradition, but brought new insights into how the philosophical systems- madhyamaka, yogacara, tathagatagarbha- can be integrated.

But there’s a provocative twist. Cal, the narrator -- also Callie -- is a hermaphrodite. And the explanation for this takes us spooling back in time, through a breathtaking review of the twentieth century, to 1922, when the Turks sacked Smyrna and Callie’s grandparents fled for their lives. Back to a tiny village in Asia Minor where two lovers, and one rare genetic mutation, set our narrator’s life in motion.

Before I try, let me say that ""Middlesex"" was one of the best novels I've read this year, or the last, for that matter.Jeffrey Eugenides captures the reader from the very beginning. We are not sure who we are reading about. Or what. The reader has no choice but continue reading to figure it out. Even once we figure it out, we have to find out what happens. Such is the power of ""Middlesex"".We are introduced to Cal, a Greek-American diplomat working at the U.S. embassy in Berlin. Seemingly attractive, he is strangely skittish about allowing girls near him. And there is a reason for it: Cal was born as Calliope, a hermaphrodite; Calliope who, due to her parents desire for a girl and the old doctor's inability to detect a second set of genitalia, is declared a girl. In fact, Calliope suffers from the 5-alpha-reductase deficiency; a mutation of 5-alpha-reductase, an enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, causing the children with this mutation to be born with (among others) ambiguous genitalia, but female primary sex characteristics. Meaning - Calliope looked and sounded like a girl... but wasn't.The author takes us through the story while speaking in first person, and in order to appease the confused looks on readers' faces, he takes us back, way back, to the time of Cal's grandparents; we see their life in Greek Anatolia (what is now Turkey), and the extermination of the locals by the advanced Turkish army. We also see the flight of Cal's grandparents, and their forbidden love, which gets a new chance with their chance of going to America.Ok, I don't think I can say much more without revealing some major plot lines. However, I can say that Eugenides weaved the story of this Greek family so expertly, that I was completely and utterly absorbed. With succinct and easy-going prose we are told the entire story. No, nothing sick and twisted about Cal's growing up, to the detriment of some readers. This is not a story meant to please by scandalizing, but a story portraying an unfortunate child and his struggle with his identity. he story itself, when looked at from a side, is actually heart wrenching, but it is told with such proficiency and warmth, that we feel right at home with the narrator.Rare is the book that will evoke an outward display of emotion with me. I generally internalize all emotions caused by a book. ""Middlesex"" made me laugh and cry, often in the same chapter, if not paragraph. Such wonderful sense of humor, used to chase away the ""woe is me"" attitude that too many people with less problems have, make this character that much more endearing. No, I didn't forget the other characters: believe me, they are just as rich and real as the character of Cal. Even the title itself has a clever double meaning: it is what a person with ambiguous genitalia is called, and is also the name of the street on which Cal grew up with his secret. And one can't help but wonder how many people go through what Cal went through, but never speak up. Very highly recommended.***Also published on Epinions.",2011,en

Do you love cozy mysteries If you answered yes to all of the above, then the new Alice Nestleton series by Lydia Adamson are the right stuff for you. This is a light but highly inventive mystery and I can tell it will be a successful series. In this first installment, we are introduced to a courageous sleuth by the name of Alice Nestleton. She is an off-off-Broadway actress, who is trying to move away from the classical Shakespeare plays and into the new avant-garde theatre. In the meantime, she supplements her vocation with cat-sitting around New York. As befitting a cat-lover, Alice has two cats: a Maine Coon named Bushy, and a frightened, domestic gray shorthair she rescued from the ASPCA by the name of Pancho. It's Christmas time and Alice is preparing for her annual cat-sitting job in a run-down horse-farm near the Hamptons, taking care of eight Himalayans for Harry and Jo Starobin; he a famous ex-cat judge and champion animal lover, she his faithful wife. When Harry fails to pick her up at the local train station as previously arranged, Alice is intrigued. She finds her own way to the farm via a taxi. Upon arrival, Alice finds things eerily normal, but it is only when she starts to get settled into her cottage that she finds Harry's corpse hanging from the back of the door. When a second murder happens to one of Harry's friends who lived just down the road, Alice puts her powers of deduction to work. She will have to deal with a pestering detective, Starobin's grieving widow and his young lover who surreptitiously disappears along with a calico barn cat and all her kittens. A connection? Maybe. Alice decides the case is worth investigating when Jo Starobin shows her a very large sum of money her husband left without explanation of how he got it. In order to solve the case, Alice will put her own life at risk, entering into high-stakes involving horse-racing and special cat genetics, geared toward producing miraculous mascots in the shape of calico cats.""A cat in the manger"" has the perfect mix of cat lore and sleuthing. I especially enjoyed the way the cats are very much at the center of the story, but they do not possess special powers. This leaves a good balance for the main character - the sleuth - to play her role naturally. Ms. Adamson obviously knows her craft very well, which involves not only the world of cats, but how to develop a good story thanks to what I sense is a background in the theatre industry.",2012,en

Part of the Macmillan Collector’s Library; a series of stunning, clothbound, pocket sized classics with gold foiled edges and ribbon markers. These beautiful books make perfect gifts or a treat for any book lover. This beautiful Macmillan Collector's Library edition features an afterword by David Stuart Davies. The Great Gatsby lives mysteriously in a luxurious Long Island mansion, playing lavish host to hundreds of people. And yet no one seems to know him or how he became so rich. He is rumoured to be everything from a German spy to a war hero. People clamour for invitations to his wild parties. But Jay Gatsby doesn't heed them. He cares for one person alone - Daisy Buchanan, the woman he has waited for all his life. Little does he know that his infatuation will lead to tragedy and end in murder.",['F. Scott Fitzgerald'],Pan Macmillan,2016-09-08,['Fiction'],B000HLFD4K,AGEIT17HENDIS,1/2,5.0,1176768000,ON THE ART OF REINVENTING ONESELF-AND THE CRAFT OF TELLING THE TALE,"One would have to be rather pedantic not recognize that F. Scott Fitzgerald was an important novelistic voice of the Jazz Age in post World War I America. Certainly nobody has chronicled the end of the age of American innocence signaled by the Jazz Age better than Fitzgerald.Fitzgerald certainly was not the only voice of that age but the voice that best exemplified the tensions between the mores of `old wealth' and the emerging sources of `new wealth' that were produced by the huge amount of money available, mainly through government contracts, as result of the war or riches gained through the illegal liquor trade. That is the sociological underpinning that drives Fitzgerald's work.There is no better example of those tensions than Jay Gatsby. If nothing else it is a dramatic enactment of the strivings of the new money to `make it' in the world of high society, one way or another. And what better way to do that than in the age old tradition of buying one's way into that society through marriage. This is the modern American version of that story.And the story itself? One Jay Gatsby, the former Jimmy Ganz, freshly reinventing himself after indeterminate service in the American military in World War I and loaded with cash from questionable financial resources, attempts to win, or rather re-win the affections of one Daisy Buchanan his vision of the perfect life companion and exemplar of the `old money' crowd that he wishes to crash. One little complication, however, gets in the way. She has found herself married to a brutish but very wealthy member of that `old money' crowd. Gatsby's lavish but fumbling attempts to lure her away from the high society of Long Island, then the summer watering hole of the `old money', forms the core of the story.Gatsby's trial and tribulations on the way as narrated by Nick Carroway (and Gatsby's somewhat unwitting accomplice in the Daisy matter) keeps the story line going until the final deadly ending. The morale- the very rich are indeed very different from you or I. Moreover, someone else will always have to pick up the messes they have made for themselves. They merely move on. This may serve as a cautionary tale for that time and possibly today.A word on literary merits. According to the inevitable changes in literary fashion as well as literary politics Fitzgerald, for long a leading figure in the canon of American literature, has been somewhat eclipsed by other more post-modernist trends. While I firmly believe that the Western canon is in dire need of expansion to include `third world', woman and minority voices Fitzgerald's literary merits stand on their own. His tightly- crafted story line, his sense of language and the flat-out fact that that he knew the subject matter that formed the basis of his expositions merit renewed consideration by today's reader.Simply put, if you want to understand part of what was going on in America in the 1920's before the Great Crash of 1929 then you simply have to read the man. If nothing else read the last few pages of Gatsby. If there is a better literary expression of the promise of America as seem by the early Dutch settlers of New York as the last best hope of civilization and the failure of that promise at the hands of the `robber barons' and their descendents I have not read it.",2016,en
Say When : A Novel,"One of the The Wall Street Journal's 10 Best Fiction Books of 2019 ""A gem of a book . . . lyrical, tender, and profoundly insightful.""--Abraham Verghese, author of Cutting for Stone A beautiful, bracingly honest debut novel about the triangle formed between a young woman and the couple whose life she enters one transformative year: a story about love and compassion, the fluidity of desire, and the myriad ways of devotion. Ella is nearing thirty, and not yet living the life she imagined. Her artistic ambitions as a student in Minnesota have given way to an unintended career in caregiving. One spring, Bryn--a retired carpenter--hires her to help him care for Jill, his wife of many years. A car accident caused a brain injury that has left Jill verbally diminished; she moves about the house like a ghost of her former self, often able to utter, like an incantation, only the words that comprise this novel's title. As Ella is drawn ever deeper into the couple's household, her presence unwanted but wholly necessary, she is profoundly moved by the tenderness Bryn shows toward the wife he still fiercely loves. Ella is startled by the yearning this awakens in her, one that complicates her feelings for her girlfriend, Alix, and causes her to look at relationships of all kinds--between partners, between employer and employee, and above all between men and women--in new ways. Tightly woven, humane and insightful, tracing unflinchingly the most intimate reaches of a young woman's heart and mind, Say Say Say is a riveting story about what it means to love, in a world where time is always running out.",['Lila Savage'],Vintage,2019-07-09,['Fiction'],B0008EH6M8,A37T1AYN11IGLH,12/15,4.0,1058572800,Berg continually entertains me!,"Elizabeth Berg flips the tables with...

The Costs of War: America's Pyrrhic Victories,"The greatest accomplishment of Western civilization is arguably the achievement of individual liberty through limits on the power of the state. In the war-torn twentieth century, we rarely hear that one of the main costs of armed conflict is long-term loss of liberty to winners and losers alike. Beyond the obvious and direct costs of dead and wounded soldiers, there is the lifetime struggle of veterans to live with their nightmares and their injuries; the hidden economic costs of inflation, debts, and taxes; and more generally the damages caused to our culture, our morality, and to civilization at large. The new edition is now available in paperback, with a number of new essays. It represents a large-scale collective effort to pierce the veils of myth and propaganda to reveal the true costs of war, above all, the cost to liberty.Central to this volume are the views of Ludwig von Mises on war and foreign policy. Mises argued that war, along with colonialism and imperialism, is the greatest enemy of freedom and prosperity, and that peace throughout the world cannot be achieved until the central governments of the major nations become limited in scope and power. In the spirit of these theorems by Mises, the contributors to this volume consider the costs of war generally and assess specific corrosive effects of major American wars since the Revolution. The first section includes chapters on the theoretical and institutional dimensions of the relationship between war and society, including conscription, infringements on freedom, the military as an engine of social change, war and literature, and the right of citizens to bear arms. The second group includes reconsiderations of Lincoln and Churchill, an analysis of the anti-interventionist idea in American politics, a discussion of the meaning of the ""just war,"" an assessment of how World War I changed the course of Western civilization, and finally two eyewitness accounts of the true horrors of actual combat by",['John Denson'],Routledge,2017-07-05,['History'],0765804875,A1LG7Q99JQBB5U,5/5,5.0,1208563200,One of the Most Important Books Published in the Past Thirty Years,"This seering uncompromising volume is one of the most important books published in the past thirty years.The many excellent chapters penned by world-class historians and analysts destroy the mendacious rationale for the welfare-warfare state, that monstrocity at war with America itself and the world.In particular, Murray N.

Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of ""Little Women"" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends ""poor little rich boy"" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to ""Little Women"" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-""blood and thunder"" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- ""scribbling"" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (""Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour""). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the ""perfect little homemaker"" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.""Little Women"" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

She becomes obssessed with the oldest son, the murderer who tears apart his family.Adam is the hero and lover, who is known as a villain and murderer for much of his life. He is driven by his emotions, but he forces purgatory for his soul after failing to leash the animal in him. Although he is the heir to wealth and status, he becomes a recluse, escaping to an secluded city in Africa to atone (and escape the cops). Despite his self-banishment from society, he is still obsessed with the theory that drives his life.Ever since he was a child, he has had dreams of a woman whom he knows from the depths of his soul to be his soulmate. Although he is plagued with dyslexia, he is a deep, brooding, thinker -- and, his paradigm is based on the idea of reincarnation -- of soulmates, whose lives are blown by celestial winds through time, which intersect in the happy lifetimes. In the isolation and seclusion of the thunderous winds of the desert city he has exiled himself to, he overcomes his disability, and he writes his soul to this unknown woman, whom he is certain he would meet in this lifetime.And, they do meet. Although, it is after much suspense, and well past the first half of the book. Their short time together is perhaps reminiscent of the fact that there is little in life that is solely pleasurable -- the strife and hassle gone into allowing that little pleasure far exceeds in time.A beautiful scene:Although Adam has poured many nights into hundreds, if not thousands, of letters to Justine, he becomes overcome with despair (along with the reader) that he is merely fooling himself, attached to a flawed view of the world. Moreover, he realizes his despicable past -- he, a murderer, and his soulmate, the innocent angel whom he would not want to debase with his association. Thus, in one fell swoop, he gathers up all the letters -- penned in such precise ink, the triumph of his overcoming his dyslexia, the writs immortalizing his soul -- and sends them off into the heavy winds of the desert town in Africa that is his prison from the world. Words of love divine flutter through the air, dancing towards their end, as the elements, reality, destroy their contents.A beautiful motif:Throughout the story, there is the semblance of a wolf, an animal of some sort, guiding and representing and foreshadowing. The wolf is seen to rush to Paradine Park before Justine's arrival -- foreshadowing her intercepting the wildness of the winds of fate. The wolf is present as ""thoughtographs"" (a nifty theory I came to learn from this book) through her photos of what appears to be empty rooms -- photos, which develop to show the image of a wolf moving through the rooms. The sense of the wolf, the animal, approaching her, each night coming closer and closer to her alludes to the winds of fate working, twisting their lives closer and closer together, until the night Adam arrives in her bedroom in Paradine Park. The brutal murdering of the strandwolf cubs signifies the first vulnerability of the wildness of fate -- the force of the lives of others (evil Russian guy) can break its beautiful matchmaking. When Justine is overcome with the despair and pathos of Adam's end, the wolf comes to her, and she beckons it to approach her, but it leaves her -- as if fate telling her that her time is not yet to come. The wolf also guides her in running towards Adam, in the end.Ultimately, though, I can understand why everyone else decided to wreck havoc on Mostert's ratings in revenge for their tears and heartbreaks... The doom of one lover is caused by some of the most twisted villains ever in a romance novel. I was nearly retching, after forcing myself through the magnum opus of twisted villain #1 and then having to stifle the dinner about to flee from my open mouth through the vileness of villain #2 -- gosh, it was horrible!The fact that no Deus ex Machina (although, it was a purely possible thing -- as that bozo did leave the tanks within range! - she could have had Adam's mind become suddenly overcome with a windwalker spirit that guides him to it) came to save the day adds pathos points (though breaks hearts... and typical romance readers were probably not expecting a not-happily-ever-after-at-all ending).The truth is -- the novel is strikingly realistic. With elegant foreshadowing and descriptions of the villains' motives and thoughts, it's undeniable that the events had to happen as they did. (But, jeez, if only he had wandered towards the other caves, rather than waste his last breaths carving out her name...)The characters are served their purpose (""clashing divine agenda"") in their lives. Justine's goal in this life is self-realization, while Adam's was redemption. Adam died by saving his best friend, the good doctor, who is responsible for the well-being of the whole town -- this amends his fratricide. Justine, at first, does not believe in Adam's dogmatic conviction on reincarnation and fated lovers whose lives are but strands in some celestial weaving. She survives, despite Adam's death, and she manages to find joy in life -- though without Adam, it is a limited, nostalgic joy -- and to finally accept and understand Adam's dogma.The Epilogue makes amend for the heartbreak (slightly - I admit, I felt like crying - whenever my thoughts trampled on this finished novel - throughout the days after I read it. I admit that despite all the superstition I believe in, a large part of me is still stuck in Justine's mindframe: that there is but one life to live and let live.), but we are left with the classic Titanic ending -- I do believe this is formulaic in generating more tears from the reader.As a final note -- the ""explicit"" scenes were not so steamy, which when put in juxtaposition next to other romances (whose excellence often apexes in such X-rated scenes), does not actually make it that weak. That is so primarily because of the novel's perks. The characters are vividly developed. One comes to love Justine and Adam and to understand the villains. (However, for a romance novel, I would certainly have made the villains less twisted and demented... Honestly, I just wasn't prepared for their sheer evilness -- not dark, sexy evilness, but icky, sicko, can-sane-men-really-think-like-this mess.) Moreover, the beauty crafted in the story and scenery is simply awe-inspiring.The ending leaves me wondering: Will Mostert create a sequel of a different life where Justine and Adam do live happily ever after?I suppose my question would be better answered by the mysterious reason as to why they didn't make a sequel to the Titanic.

The Great Gatsby lives mysteriously in a luxurious Long Island mansion, playing lavish host to hundreds of people. And yet no one seems to know him or how he became so rich. He is rumoured to be everything from a German spy to a war hero. People clamour for invitations to his wild parties. But Jay Gatsby doesn't heed them. He cares for one person alone - Daisy Buchanan, the woman he has waited for all his life. Little does he know that his infatuation will lead to tragedy and end in murder.",['F. Scott Fitzgerald'],Pan Macmillan,2016-09-08,['Fiction'],B0000CO4JZ,A2XZKGL6DJA03,1/1,4.0,1345075200,"Fitzgerald's characters may not be likable, but his writing most assuredly is","Back in high school, I read F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 The Great Gatsby and Ernest Hemingway's 1926 The Sun Also Rises. At the time, I wasn't impressed with either, considering both to be shallow tales of spoiled rich folk. I gave The Sun Also Rises another chance a couple of years ago, and was so impressed with the power of Hemingway's novel that I quickly read the rest of his major works, and some of his minor. I just finished re-reading The Great Gatsby, and while it didn't leap up as much in my estimation as The Sun Also Rises, I did appreciate it more than I did back in high school.The story of The Great Gatsby does, in fact, revolve around the discontent well-off of Jazz Age New York. Our narrator, Nick Carraway, is the one decent guy in the book, while the titular Jay Gatsby, his old flame Daisy, Daisy's husband Tom Buchanan, and Carraway's love interest Jordan Baker are all despicable people in one way or another, though this time reading it, I was able to appreciate as certain tragedy to Gatsby that had previously been lost on me.The main thread of the novel it Gatsby's attempt to win Daisy back to him. There are also parties. Lots of parties. You may not know much about the mysterious Gatsby until the end of the novel, but one thing you know from the start is that he throws a hell of a party. You might also finish the novel with an urge to start calling everyone ""Old Sport."" Try to resist it.What I enjoyed most about the novel this reading was the language. Fitzgerald at times seems to be writing poetry as much as he is fiction, so lyrical and evocative is his writing. You'll finish the novel with many memorable phrases and scenes still echoing in your mind. While his contemporary and friend Hemingway wrote powerfully using as few words as possible, resembling a minimalist stone sculpture, Fitzgerald strings together glittering, complex phrases that call to mind a necklace of sparking diamonds. Between the two, I like Hemingway's approach more, but those jewels of Fitzgerald's - they do shine brightly and catch the eye.I listened to Blackstone Audio's 2007 production of The Great Gatsby, read by Anthony Heald. Heald did a fantastic job with the novel. The tone he used for this production fit the Jazz Age drama perfectly, and he captured all the characters very well. I had not listened to anything narrated by Heald before, but after listening to his recording of The Great Gatsby, he's on my audio book narrator radar. The unabridged recording runs approximately five hours.In the end, I'm glad I gave The Great Gatsby another chance. I don't love it as much as I ended up loving Hemingway's work, but Fitzgerald's most famous novel was well worth reading again, and it has a fitting place as an American classic.",2016,en

But as the miles slipped beneath the tyres of their big BMWs, their troubles started. Exhaustion, injury and accidents tested their strength. Treacherous roads, unpredictable weather and turbulent politics challenged their stamina. They were chased by paparazzi in Kazakhstan, courted by men with very large guns in the Ukraine, hassled by the police, and given bulls' testicles for supper by Mongolian nomads. And yet despite all these obstacles they managed to ride more than twenty thousand miles in four months, changing their lives forever in the process.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle killed off Sherlock Holmes at one point, only to resurrect him at the demand of his fans. Elizabeth George too has recently attempted to bypass her Inspector Lynley, much to her fans chagrin (include me among that list). With &quot;An Unsuitable Job for a Woman,&quot; I suspect we find the same motive with P.D. James' divergence from the Dalgliesh novels. Instead of the inimitable and formidable Dalgliesh, we have the 22-year-old, sometimes uncertain Cordelia Gray attempting to jumpstart a detective agency willed to her through the suicide of her benefactor and mentor, Bernie Pryde.In the course of &quot;Unsuitable&quot; and a companion book &quot;The Skull Beneath the Skin,&quot; Ms. James produces one of the great characters of detective fiction. Lacking very little professional experience, Cordelia uses instinct, a sharp mind and surprising courage to unravel the truth to murders that on the surface seem so obviously solvable.It is not until the conclusion of the &quot;Unsuitable&quot; case that Dalgliesh shows up to clear away some of the messy details, but its clearly Cordelia's story that Ms. James is focused upon.Read this book, and then immediate procure &quot;Skull,&quot; the far superior book in the very short two-book series. In my mind, they both are far better written, more exciting than any of the Dalgliesh series (I can't believe I am saying that - that's like saying an orange is better than an apple).Ms. James never returns to Cordelia, other than a couple of brief mentions in later Dalgliesh stories. Once, she sends Dalgliesh flowers and a short note while he is recovering from an illness, and there is a slight hint of romantic interest - moreso on her part than perhaps on the continual mourning Dalgliesh.About a year ago, Ms. James was in my hometown promoting her autobiography (a nice read, but not particularly well put together). Numerous questions were posed regarding Cordelia. Her response was that she is constantly amazed how popular a character is Cordelia, and admits that yes, SHE too loved her. But, she said, Dalgliesh pulled her back. I personally asked her during the book autographing stage whether Cordelia any chance of reappearing. Keeping in mind that Ms. James is well into her 80s, it was probably a silly question. But she said she had considered it, but that she made an awful mistake. She said she had &quot;inexplicably sold Cordelia&quot; to the BBC, who had promised her that when dramatizing &quot;Unsuitable&quot; and &quot;Skull,&quot; they would keep the character true to the book. They did so until the actress portraying her came up pregnant during filming, so they wrote into it that Cordelia was also pregnant from a liason with a lover that she no longer was seeing. Anyone who has read and loved these books know that that would have been totally out of character for Cordelia. Ms. James said she was so angry that she traveled the book circuit saying Cordelia of the BBC was NOT the Cordelia of her two books. Unfortunately, she said, &quot;I don't know how I can bring her back onto the pages. She's dead to me now.&quot;So read the books, but never no never go near the televised series. Cordelia is very much alive in these pages, and you will be ever so glad.",2012,en

After grudgingly completing the novel and surmising that only nostalgia could provoke such admiration for the novel, I gave it a sold two-star rating and suggested to myself that a collection of short stories by Cordwainer Smith may hold some redemption. Here is where I stared down my copy of Space Lords and swore at it not to annoy be as much as Norstrilia did in the prior year: absurdity springing up everywhere, bad poetry and ballads spread throughout, and a plot direction with less bearing than a drunk giraffe.------------Mother Hitton's Littul Kittons (1961, novelette) - 4/5 - Benjacomin Bozart, the Senior Warden of the Guild of Thieves on the planet Viole Siderea, has been training for two hundred years along with three hundred thousand people to rob the riches from the wealthiest planet of Norstrilia. His tourist disguise gives him access to a calm people, but the secrets divulged are unknowingly laced with subterfuge of their own. All his planning is null is he meets the psychotic minks of Mother Hitton. 24 pages ----- This is when absurdity can be effective, when one absurd plot is supplanted by another even more absurd countermeasure. It's silly and bit scary, but nevertheless effective.The Dead Lady of Clown Town (1964, novella) - 1/5 - Descending from the New City to a realm of surreal underpeople and a bodiless computer, the human therapist Elaine is oblivious to her prophetic stature to the Old City denizens of human-form: rats, bears, goats, snakes, and bison. Through doors and meeting a wider cast of eccentric characters both human and underhuman, Elaine finds herself back on Earth entwined in fate and mentality with the once dog underhuman D'joan. 77 pages ----- Absurdity typically has a difficult uphill battle with aimlessness, and here is where aimlessness rears its head and leaves the reader asking for logical progression and direction.Drunkboat (1963, novelette) - 2/5 - Lord Crudelta, of the Instrumentality, straps Artyr Rambo on a rocket, tells him his love is dead or dying, and leaves him to his own means to get to Earth. A hospital on Earth finds Rambo on their grounds without a ship and without clothes. He mindlessly ignores hospital attire and performs swimming strokes on the room's floor, while the doctors are baffled. When Lord Crudelta comes to Earth, his dirty actions are apparent. 32 pages ----- The ""how"" is usually regarded as a null point when the ""why"" overshadows an absurd plot. But here even the ""why"" fails to produce on more levels than one.The Ballard of Lost C'mell (1962, novelette) - 3/5 - Lord Jestocost is inspired like no one else to help the underprivileged underpeople and he has just found his ticket to benevolent emancipation using his telepathy. C'mell utters the name ""Ee-telly-kelly"" during her father's funeral and Lord Jestocost summons her to divulge the same name of her people's secret leader. Once ethereally summoned, the two strategize how to develop the underpeople's rights under the noses of the Lords. 21 pages ----- It's at all typical when as absurd story has a good humanistic thread woven into it, but the non-corporeal leader of the underpeople seems too whimsical to be dramatic.A Planet Named Shayol (1961, novelette) - 4/5 - Mercer has committed a heinous crime against the imperial family and is sent to an orbital hospital to prepare for the tough life on the prison planet of Shayol. The deprivation on the planet is experienced by all who reside there, all their needs taken care of by the skin-piercing dromozoa. Once locally infected, each site grows a human limb or organ, which is lopped off and sent back to the hospital. Death is their only hope. 38 pages ----- Here's an excellent horror/absurd story where the horror builds dramatically only to be deftly cut short of a decent ending. Best story in the collection!------------On the subject of bad poetry and ballads, Cordwainer Smith has this to say in his epilogue:""One last word about the bits of incidental verse. I am one of the most minor poets of America, but I thoroughly enjoy incorporating it into science fiction. I am not happy about the 1960s and with the terrible divorce which now exists between poetry and people in most of the English-speaking world. Something is wrong. Perhaps the poets. Perhaps the people. Perhaps you. Perhaps me"" (206).He may like to rhyme and perform repetition, but those are about the only poetry skills the man possesses. He says he ""used Chinese, Persian, and Japanese verse forms with English words and rhythms"" (206) but much of this was probably lost on the reader. Then again, I guess it depends on why the reader is reading the book. If it's for nostalgia, then the poetry may be a brilliant addition to the wonderfully absurd stories, but if you're approaching the short story collection with a perceptive and discerning eye, then the quality of the stories may match the quality of the poetry.A fantastic cover by Jack Gaughan (Pyramid Books, 1968)!I'll skip any more Cordwainer in the future but I will preserve this copy on my shelves for the two haunting tales which sandwich the lesser tales between them.",2016,en

Many, many people are missing the point that while the community in which this takes place is painted as a utopia, it is decidedly not, which is what Jonas comes to realize by the end of the novel. Yes, in the book, the elderly are not valued, nor are birth mothers, lower-weight twins, the sick and mentally handicapped; however, as the book progresses, one realizes along with Jonas the absurdity of the values this ""utopia"" holds and comes to appreciate diversity in all forms. This book challenges the reader to examine their beliefs and embrace life.Yes, this book does touch on more adult topics like euthanasia, puberty and sexual urges, war, etc., but these are not topics that are foreign to everyone under the age of 14, and there is no reason a mature younger child should not be allowed to read and enjoy the book. Can it be scary to someone not ready for it? Yes, perhaps, but I would challenge the parents of the scared child to discuss the issues presented in the book with their child and help them realize that this is a ""what if"" story and does not, thankfully, represent reality - yet.I can appreciate how some might find this story boring and some younger readers may not understand what is happening, and therefore not appreciate it.

By morning, the millionaire Samuel Edward Ratchett lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside. One of his fellow passengers must be the murderer. Isolated by the storm, detective Hercule Poirot must find the killer among a dozen of the dead man's enemies, before the murderer decides to strike again . . .",['Agatha Christie'],Harper Collins,2011-03-29,['Fiction'],B0008A8LPS,A384P5XYDRGBCF,1/1,5.0,1355356800,Excellent Christie book (1934) and movie (1974),"I'm combining this review of the book and movie together because the stories are so closely related, and I think that anyone who likes the movie will be interested to know about the book, and readers who have enjoyed the book may like to get some details about the movie. The 1974 movie is a true classic, and along with many others I look forward to the time when it will be digitally restored and issued on blu-ray disk.I love the 1974 Murder on the Orient Express movie and have watched it several times over the years on TV and DVD. I've only recently read the book for the first time on Kindle, and was frankly quite amazed to see how faithful the movie was to Christie's novel of the same title written in 1934. Since most of the story takes place on a train, it was relatively easy for producers to keep the movie closely aligned to the book even in many small details, and I'm grateful that they did. After reading the book and seeing how Christie portrayed Poirot as being a more quiet and low key personality, I can appreciate that some criticize the selection and performance of Albert Finney as Poirot because he is often quite emotional and demonstrative, as well as physically different than the Poirot Christie described. This is the only major difference between the 1974 movie and the book, though it can be a crucial difference for Christie fans. I have not seen the later version starring David Souchet as Poirot, but from the reviews on Amazon it seems that at least some changes were made to the story so it apparently does not adhere as closely to the book. I won't comment further on this since I haven't seen it.Christie's story is loosely based on the actual kidnapping of aviator Charles Lindbergh's 20-month-old son in 1932. A $50,000 ransom was paid but the baby was murdered and his body was found two months later. A household servant who was suspected by the police of playing a part in the kidnapping did commit suicide.In Christie's story, Hercule Poirot is returning to England aboard the Orient Express. The train is halted at night because of heavy snow and a passenger is found murdered in his bed the following morning. A doctor happens to be on board and tells Poirot that there are twelve stab wounds in the body. Everyone in the coach is a suspect, but what was the motive? Poirot must wade through the maze of contradictory clues and apparent impossibilities, some of which make him recall a child kidnapping/murder that happened a few years previously.The 1974 movie was stylishly done with great performances by an all star cast, and the music is also wonderful.

Anna Karenina - translated from the Russian by Constance Garnett,"""Anna Karenina"" is the tragic story of Countess Anna Karenina, a married noblewoman and socialite, and her affair with the affluent Count Vronsky. The novel explores a diverse range of topics throughout its approximately one thousand pages. Some of these topics include an evaluation of the feudal system that existed in Russia at the time—politics, not only in the Russian government but also at the level of the individual characters and families, religion, morality, gender and social class. Leo Tolstoy (1828–1910) was a Russian writer who is regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time. Born to an aristocratic Russian family in 1828, he is best known for the novels War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877), often cited as pinnacles of realist fiction. Constance Garnett (1861–1946) was an English translator of nineteenth-century Russian literature. Garnett was one of the first English translators of Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Anton Chekhov and introduced them on a wide basis to the English-speaking public.",['Leo Tolstoy'],e-artnow,2017-11-15,['Fiction'],B000I364KE,A13AZV8BY8P065,0/7,4.0,1202428800,Looks Good,"Haven't had a chance to read the book yet.

Henderson the Rain King,"""It blazes as fiercely and scintillatingly as a forest fire. There is life here; a great rage to live more fully. In this it is a giant among novels."" (San Francisco Examiner) A Penguin Classic Saul Bellow evokes all the rich colors and exotic customs of a highly imaginary Africa in this acclaimed comic novel about a middle-aged American millionaire who, seeking a new, more rewarding life, descends upon an African tribe. Henderson’s awesome feats of strength and his unbridled passion for life win him the admiration of the tribe—but it is his gift for making rain that turns him from mere hero into messiah. A hilarious, often ribald story, Henderson the Rain King is also a profound look at the forces that drive a man through life. This Penguin Classics edition contains an introduction by Adam Kirsch.

The basic premise is comedic: a grumpy, spoiled, acerbic, rich American in his 50's seeks to discover meaning and wisdom and fulfillment by leaving New York and traveling to Africa to live and commune with a primitive African tribe. If this induces at least a subtle chuckle, then it is safe to say that you'd be laughing frequently through this hilarious and sometimes ribald romp. Not enough? Then consider that it has been named as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century by the well-respected Modern Library.Henderson is an independently wealthy man in his 50's who is unhappily married to his second wife, and when he gets to the point where he can stand his meager existence no longer and the trivial aimlessness of it all, he hires a guide to take him to the remote, African sahara, to the most primitive tribe they can find. They first end up with the Arnewi tribe, where Henderson becomes obsessed with the tribe's superstitious obsession with the frogs in the cistern, which keeps them from watering their cattle, and so in his attempt to rid them of this malady he ends up blowing up the whole thing while fending off the advances of a large women who is considered a beauty due to her &quot;bittahness.&quot; After destroying the cistern, Henderson and his guide escape and try again with the Wariri tribe where he impresses the natives with his unparalleled feats of strength (Festivus, anyone?), which then propels him unwittingly into the position of sungo (rain king) when rain immediately follows. There he befriends the king of the tribe, Dahfu, and the tale of Henderson carries us on a humorous journey where we come face to face with lions, tall amazonian women, and scheming uncles.Henderson is an interesting counter figure to someone like, say, Roth's Swede Levov (American Pastoral), where both men have a privileged adulthood but yet both are incapable of settling down into it. Levov gets tragically ripped away while Henderson is comically tied to it even in the far reaches of Africa. Henderson's pretentiousness and bombastic response to everything (his attempt to kill his little house cat still makes me laugh) makes him the perfect target for Dahfu's psychological experiment, for even in his gregariousness, Henderson's goal is to existentially discover the importance of being an intricate, vital element of some grand venture, which Dahfu supplies.One might fall into the temptation of reading this book as a generic critique of the dangers of &quot;civilization&quot; within a sort of Rousseauian framework, although the &quot;savages&quot; in Bellow's book are something less than entirely &quot;noble.&quot; Nevertheless, I decline to read it this way, for I think the book speaks to psychology, to the inner man, to the aspirations and &quot;life-force&quot; in a discontented soul, rather than to politics or history or the delimitating ways in which cultural norms interact with those on other continents. Or, one could just sit back and have a grand old time laughing at Henderson, and the fact that he laughs at himself, even in his gargantuan seriousness, makes us love him all the more. He's like that grouchy, eccentric grandfather we can't help but love, even in his most obnoxious cantankerousness.The bottom line, though, is that this book is terribly funny and clever, and Bellow has a way of avoiding the negative qualities of stream-of-consciousness prose while at the same time distilling from it its funnier aspects. This was the first Saul Bellow book that I had ever read, but immediately afterwards I put several more on my reading list.",2012,en
Middlesex [Unabridged Audiobook],"Spanning eight decades and chronicling the wild ride of a Greek-American family through the vicissitudes of the twentieth century, Jeffrey Eugenides’ witty, exuberant novel on one level tells a traditional story about three generations of a fantastic, absurd, lovable immigrant family -- blessed and cursed with generous doses of tragedy and high comedy. But there’s a provocative twist. Cal, the narrator -- also Callie -- is a hermaphrodite. And the explanation for this takes us spooling back in time, through a breathtaking review of the twentieth century, to 1922, when the Turks sacked Smyrna and Callie’s grandparents fled for their lives. Back to a tiny village in Asia Minor where two lovers, and one rare genetic mutation, set our narrator’s life in motion. Middlesex is a grand, utterly original fable of crossed bloodlines, the intricacies of gender, and the deep, untidy promptings of desire.

Orlando : a biography,"Published by Hogarth Press in 1928, Orlando is at once an oddity, an indulgence, but also a slice of genius. The novel – because despite masquerading as a biography, it is a work of narrative fiction – tells the unlikely, impossible story of Orlando through his years as a male member of the Elizabethan Court, an affair with a Russian Princess, a subdued period of contemplation during the reign of James 1, his time as an ambassador in Constantinople and the sudden transformation into a woman. Not content with such a plot twist Woolf allows her character to live on through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, using the journey to trace the female place in society while allowing Orlando the freedom to seduce, be seduced and to love in equal measure. After 80,000 words, Woolf leaves her heroine in the England of 1928 having completed a poem, The Oak Tree, that had been started some four centuries earlier.",['Virginia Woolf'],"Lulu Press, Inc",2013-09-04,['Fiction'],B0007KB17O,A1FIHJGB9Q1LNB,9/53,2.0,1124755200,Orlando,".....isn't that someplace in Florida?It would be interesting to see what old VW would have made of that section of the planet had she decided to incorporate it into her novel.

The novel is unlike any other your will ever be likely to read. The scenes of the Black Mass in James Joyce's Ulyssess, inside an Irish whore house, are perhaps the closest literary experience to Burrough's Naked Lunch. Ironically, for a noble and steadfast reader, Burroughs places the &quot;prologue&quot; for NL at the end of the book. I found reading this very helpful to understanding the novel, as much as I could understand it on first read.Burrough's placement is not arbertrary, to say the least.

Such is addiction to junk, nothing glamerous, only pain, death, madness, and the relentless search for the next fix.But for those willing to embark on this journey into hell, be advised that the best advice, echoed by several reviewers here, is to just read the words and don't force a meaning into them...you will find no meaning in addiction to junk, only pathos and dispair.",2015,en

Database Backed Web Sites: The Thinking Person's Guide to Web Publishing,"An examination of more than sixty years of successes and failures in developing technologies that allow computers to understand human spoken language. Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey famously featured HAL, a computer with the ability to hold lengthy conversations with his fellow space travelers. More than forty years later, we have advanced computer technology that Kubrick never imagined, but we do not have computers that talk and understand speech as HAL did. Is it a failure of our technology that we have not gotten much further than an automated voice that tells us to “say or press 1”? Or is there something fundamental in human language and speech that we do not yet understand deeply enough to be able to replicate in a computer? In The Voice in the Machine, Roberto Pieraccini examines six decades of work in science and technology to develop computers that can interact with humans using speech and the industry that has arisen around the quest for these technologies. He shows that although the computers today that understand speech may not have HAL's capacity for conversation, they have capabilities that make them usable in many applications today and are on a fast track of improvement and innovation. Pieraccini describes the evolution of speech recognition and speech understanding processes from waveform methods to artificial intelligence approaches to statistical learning and modeling of human speech based on a rigorous mathematical model—specifically, Hidden Markov Models (HMM). He details the development of dialog systems, the ability to produce speech, and the process of bringing talking machines to the market. Finally, he asks a question that only the future can answer: will we end up with HAL-like computers or something completely unexpected?",['Roberto Pieraccini'],MIT Press,2012-03-23,['Computers'],1562765302,A2NPSKJ12HHEGR,0/0,5.0,888969600,Cocky MIT Unix loving Greenspun writes another great read.,"Greenspun paints the whole of website creation with a writing style that allows the whole book to be an enjoyable cover to cover learning experience.

I wasted an entire quarter reading through (and yelling at) this book to get a good GPA. Howard Zinn is a socialist, pushing his agenda. It's as simple as that.Important pieces of history are left out (The Articles of Confederation, the first supreme law of the land which tried a lesser federal government and put the power in the hands of the states; The Prohibition era), while others are judged with weak arguments and flaws in logic. There are several cases where Zinn will quote a fact or a statistic, and then either make an insane logic jump (So-and-so, when he was running for office, spoke out against racism. No doubt he was a filthy liar), or skew the statistic to the skies (23% of people said the welfare system is in trouble, while 75% of people said that the government should help the poor. Obviously the word ""welfare"" is a buzz word that turns people off.)Howard Zinn uses ""evidence"" to support his claims, but they are the quotes of individual people--for anyone who hasn't taken any kind of public speaking or research writing course, personal testimonies are NOT true evidence; they can support a claim by adding a bit of realism, but the testimonies of one or two people do not prove a case.There are a few fascinating things in this book, such as quotes from historical leaders who may not have been all they were cracked up to be.

The story caught my attention right away and I thought it was really original. I had a lot of books to buy and to read before I even could get near Uglies, but I didn't forget it.Anyway, I'm from Brazil, like you guys already know, and recently I saw lots of publicy for this book in some brazilian blogs. Turns out that the rights for this series were bought in Brazil, and the first one was published. Lots of reviews started to appear, and when reading them I got the feeling I wouldn't like this book like I first thought.What changed? Why did I finally read the book? Well, I saw a review that made me want to read it again--and after a fast exchange on twitter with the book blogger that wrote the review, I got the desire to read it again. So, thanks Juh Oliveto, from Livros&Bolinhos;, I read an incredible book.Uglies isn't just a young adult fiction. As far as the writing goes, the book is extremely well written, it has a narrative that gets you and the characters have amazing personalities. Some things are a little confusing, but overall the author made an amazing job writing it. I don't have big critics about the book, maybe a little more explanation at some points, but that's it. But Uglies is a lot more than it's writing. It's a social critic, a hard reality about how we see life, even with the author used metaphores to make his point.Uglies is a very intelligent book. Can be appreciated as just a entretaining book, for sure, but if you search for more you will find it, and that is what made this book so good for me. It's a simple book in terms of narrative, but a powerful story anyway.",2011,en

The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,"National Book Award Winner: The definitive account of Nazi Germany and “one of the most important works of history of our time” (The New York Times). When the Third Reich fell, it fell swiftly. The Nazis had little time to destroy their memos, their letters, or their diaries. William L. Shirer’s sweeping account of the Third Reich uses these unique sources, combined with his experience living in Germany as an international correspondent throughout the war. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich earned Shirer a National Book Award and continues to be recognized as one of the most important and authoritative books about the Third Reich and Nazi Germany ever written. The diaries of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, as well as evidence and other testimony gained at the Nuremberg Trials, could not have found more artful hands. Shirer gives a clear, detailed, and well-documented account of how it was that Adolf Hitler almost succeeded in conquering the world. With millions of copies in print, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a chilling and illuminating portrait of mankind’s darkest hours. “A monumental work.” —Theodore H. White",['William L.

Don't miss this magnificently researched book by an author who lived in Nazi Germany through its early formative and powerful 1930 era. With Hitler's suicide now exactly 55 years ago it remains a timeless study on an era that reshaped the world we now live in.

The Lonely Land,"The author of The Singing Wilderness and Listening Point begins this grand adventure: “There are few places left on the North American continent where men can still see the country as it was before Europeans came and know some of the challenges and freedoms of those who saw it first, but in the Canadian Northwest it can still be done. A thousand miles northwest of Lake Superior are great free rivers, lakes whose horizons disappear, countless unnamed waterways, and ridges and forested valleys still largely unknown.” Into this land of Crees, Chippewyans, Yellow Knives, and Dig Rib Indians had once come the voyageur, the Hudson Bay trader, and a succession of adventurers—gentlemen and otherwise—who used the mighty Churchill River as a major waterway from Hudson Bay to the Mackenzie. “It was the trail of these voyageurs we followed,” says the author, “a trail that led from the height of land where waters flow north to the Arctic and east to Hudson Bay, to Cumberland House five hundred miles away. Every portage, camp site, and rapids, every mile of this waterway of lakes and rivers was steeped in the drama of exploration and trade.” “We traveled as the voyageurs did by canoe, paddled the same lakes, ran the same rapids, and packed over their ancient portages. We knew the winds and storms, saw the same sky lines, and felt the awe and wonderment that was theirs at the enormous expanses and grandeur of a land that was once as strange and challenging to them as to us.” Mr. Olson has illuminated his own cruise with quotations from journals and diaries of such men as George Simpson, David Thompson, Alexander Henry, and Alexander Mackenzie—as well as a host of other explorers-traders whose voices speak from the old Moose Fort Journals of the Hudson’s Bay Company. Mr. Olson serves as the Bourgeois of the party of six—the boss who ran the trip, chose the routes, picked the camp sites. His companions and he relived for all readers of this book what life was then in the wilds of the Canadian Northwest. Mr. Olson combines his inimitable ability to evoke the beauties and wonders of the wilderness—its animals, birds, and its very spirit—with a dramatic talent for taking the reader along the route of the men who pioneered that wilderness. Francis Lee Jacques, whose genius to evoke the wilderness in pen and ink is unchallenged, has illuminated this book by his drawings, as he did The Singing Wilderness and Listening Point.",['Sigurd F. Olson'],Knopf,2012-07-04,['Travel'],B000L9Y1CI,A273R0MQLCERI8,6/6,5.0,1179273600,Rediscovery,"I first obtained this book in my youth through the old Outdoor Life Book Club (which also introduced me to other classics such as John J. Rowlands' Cache Lake Country). I'm not sure I read The Lonely Land all the way through at that first encounter, but I recently rediscovered it when cleaning out a family home. I picked it up out of nostalgia, but I soon found that I couldn't put it down.Apart from the inherent interest of its subject matter -- the majestic wilderness of central Canada's Churchill River drainage -- I was quickly taken by the immediacy of Olson's account. The wind, the waves, the thunder of approaching rapids all spill off the page in vivid detail, as do the detailed descriptions of each night's camp and its routines. As compelling is the exuberance of Olson and his five companions as they explore pristine lakes, shoot the Churchill's wild water, and find refuge time and again on the solid, reassuring outcrops of the Canadian Shield.Finally, at each stage of the journey, Olson quotes from the journals of those who came before him, the ""bourgeois"" who led the brigades of voyageurs into the heart of the Lonely Land in search of furs. Men like Alexander MacKenzie, George Simpson, and David Thompson, who worked for the Hudson's bay Company or its competitors: the record of their observations informs Olson's account with vivid descriptions of the land as well as a sense both of how much and how little had changed over the one hundred and fifty years since they had last paddled, poled, and lined their way up the same great river system.I know that Olson has many well-regarded books to his credit, but a new reader could do worse than enter this world of woods and water by way of The Lonely Land.",2012,en

The Essential 55: An Award-Winning Educator's Rules for Discovering the Successful Student in Every Child,"From the Disney Teacher of the Year and New York Times bestselling author Ron Clark comes the classic guide to bringing out the best in your students, revised and updated for today's teachers. Over 1 million copies sold! When Ron Clark walked into his fifth-grade class in rural North Carolina, he was confronted with disinterested children in desperate need of structure and compassion. Brainstorming how best to reignite their love of learning, Ron created 55 lessons. Soon his fifth graders were reading at a sixth-grade level, engaging in class, and loving school. What's more, they were gaining something crucial: self-respect. These lessons evolved into The Essential 55 - guidelines for students on how to live and interact with others. Ron lit a fire under parents and teachers around the world to raise their standards and expect the most from their students. The Essential 55 features a new foreword from Ron and a fresh take on his classic rules. Ron's 55 ideas show that with determination, discipline, and regular rewards, the children you stick by will be the children you eventually admire.",['Ron Clark'],Hachette Books,2019-04-30,['Education'],B0000YSH42,A2A3ZFNE6B1YIX,7/11,1.0,1306454400,"A ""Magical"" Set of Rules...","Wow... where to begin...Ron Clark starts the book by mentioning he is ""adventurous"". He admits to locking himself in an active oven and nearly cooking himself to death. That happened while he was at work. One would assume he should of been working and not playing hide-and-seek. A perfect model of irresponsibility and lack of work ethic. He also admits to streaking across the field of a nationally televised football game and being chased by police...Is this the guy you want to take your teaching advice from?He then mentions in the same introduction that he only showed up to apply for a teaching job because his parents threatened to cut off his funding if he didn't try. How old was this man when he was still getting money from his parents? He was old enough to teach but not old enough to have a job prior to that to fund his own ""adventures""? He then shows up at the school to appease his parents, already knowing that he won't accept the job, and completely changes his mind when ONE student asks if he will be their new teacher. At this point in the book I put it down. Kind of hard to believe right? He KNEW he wasn't going to teach- but he literally walked through a door, was spoken to by one student, and COMPLETELY changed his mind? Not exactly an adult thinking process here.I had to take a break from the book. I was told that reading this book by Ron Clark and reading the books by Rafe Esquith should be required reads for a future teacher. So I read two of Esquith's books in two days, cover to cover, and then attempted to pick this book back up. (For the record... Esquith's books are very hard to put down.)I couldn't stand it. Here is a man who created an entire system of 55 rules that are based entirely off of fear and other low level thinking. Rules such as rule #9 in which if you don't say thank you within three seconds he will take a gift back. How is this realistic? In real life are we only given a three second window to show gratitude? He took back a gift he gave to a student for having the highest score on a social studies test. Great lesson to teach Mr. Clark! You reward the girl for academic achievement with books, and then take them back because she was celebrating and didn't thank you right away. Talk about being egocentric! You aren't teaching kids to say thank you because its the right thing to do... you are teaching that they should feel anxious that they will lose what they earned or were rewarded with if they don't remember your crazy rule.Here is another good one. He gives the unrealistic consequence of detention (detention!) to a girl who didn't bring her homework assignment in. He did this because kids weren't turning in assignments. So he figured that an obnoxious and way unrealistic punishment would ""get the students attention"". When the mom of this student (who happened to be one of the most academically successful kids in class) went to the principal to complain, Clark writes that he was ""terrified"" and claims that he was on the verge of tears the entire time. But don't worry... he stuck right by his belief that this was a fair lesson to teach this girl. Anyone else rolling their eyes here?Rafe Esquith created a classroom of children known countrywide for their academic achievement AND manners. He did so by creating a classroom atmosphere that is free of fear and encourages what he calls ""Level V Thinking"" which involves doing things because you know they are the right thing to do. Not because someone told you to in THEIR set of rules. I HIGHLY suggest you read at least the first two of Esquith's books before you pick up anything written by Ron Clark. Only because you will find great comedy in Clark's transparent effort to appear ""passionate"" about the kids he teaches.Ron Clark created 55 rules that are fueled by fear. Fear of the unrealistic consequences and bullying that will come from breaking these rules. This is no way to raise children... in an atmosphere of anxiety. Anxiety already permeates our school system and we wonder why its failing! If you want some wonderful ideas to refresh your teaching perspective or help prepare for a career in teaching... do yourself a favor and avoid anything written by Clark. Teachers like Rafe Esquith are not only more decorated and successful than Clark, but actually know what they're doing and have real success to show for it.Clark may have the best intentions, and I may be off base in my accusation that he is feigning passion for dramatic effect, but he is drastically off base in his methods of teaching these valuable morale lessons. Teaching that you should do the right thing simply because it is a rule is just the wrong way to do it. Using fear and anxiety to control a classroom is the easy route. It takes no effort whatsoever and anyone who claims Clark is ""going the extra mile"" is out of their mind. Clark proves through the entire book that he lacks the maturity and adult reasoning processes to approach discipline in a positive productive manner.P.S. If you look at the numerous 5 star reviews this book gets you will notice that many of them are very similar, are 2-3 sentences in length, and are clumped together. This is usually a sign that the publisher has people posting positive reviews to boost sales.",2019,en
To Conquer the Air : The Wright Brothers and the Great Race for Flight,"James Tobin, award-winning author of Ernie Pyle's War and The Man He Became, has penned the definitive account of the inspiring and impassioned race between the Wright brothers and their primary rival Samuel Langley across ten years and two continents to conquer the air. For years, Wilbur Wright and his younger brother, Orville, experimented in obscurity, supported only by their exceptional family. Meanwhile, the world watched as Samuel Langley, armed with a contract from the US War Department and all the resources of the Smithsonian Institution, sought to create the first manned flying machine. But while Langley saw flight as a problem of power, the Wrights saw a problem of balance. Thus their machines took two very different paths—Langley’s toward oblivion, the Wrights’ toward the heavens—though not before facing countless other obstacles. With a historian’s accuracy and a novelist’s eye, Tobin has captured an extraordinary moment in history. To Conquer the Air is itself a heroic achievement.",['James Tobin'],Simon and Schuster,2012-06-12,['History'],0743528700,A3GUD4HI9WD2Q5,0/0,5.0,1322697600,Must read,A gripping account that leaves you rooting and yearning for more.

At Issue Series - Creationism versus Evolution (paperback edition),"Have you ever wondered how the universe originated or whether the universe always existed? Have you ever wondered how life began on earth? Have you ever heard others discuss origins but felt unable to contribute to the conversation? Would you like to defend your views but feel unequipped or inadequate to do so? Are you unsure about what to believe? Would you like to learn more about the subject of origins? If so, this book will be a help to you. The subject of evolution and creation often causes much contention and controversy. The question that may be asked is, Why is there so much tension and animosity between those who hold to opposing views regarding the subject of origins? Others may ask, What do those of opposing views base their beliefs upon? Is there any reconciling of the different views? The differences, I believe, in part are due to ones perceptions regarding science and theology. This book is not about Christians versus atheists. This book is more about creation versus evolution than about Creationism versus Evolutionism. This book is about comparing various views, opinions and evidence related to evolution and creation. Some of the information being presented may be new to you and may take some time to digest. Evolutionists generally view creation in the same way that creationists generally view evolution. Opposing views are rarely taken seriously, as they are a contradiction to ones own bias. Whatever your current views are regarding the origins of the universe and life or level of knowledge of origins, this book is about considering various sides of the issue of evolution. In this book we will be comparing the evidence and arguments and then weighing the pros and cons in an attempt to determine the validity of each view. You will, however, be left to make your own decisions about each subject that is presented. This book may either strengthen your current views of origins or may cause you to re-think what you currently believe about origins. Whatever your views are regarding the origins of the universe and life, this book is about considering various sides of the issue of evolution. In this book the evidence and arguments will be presented for the reader to determine the validity of each view. Subjects such as: the origin of the universe, the age of the universe, the fossil evidence, the possibilities of a global flood, the origins of life, Stanley Millers Experiment of 1953, the fossils in the strata of the earth, the components of evolution (Natural Selection, Adaptation, Mutations, Speciation, and Genetic Drift), Punctuated Equilibrium, Haeckels Embryos and Recapitulation, Vestiges, Pseudogenes, Biological Complexity and Intelligent Design, Comparing biological similarities and differences between Chimpanzee and human genome, Comparing the Human and Ape Fossil Evidence, will be examined. Multiple top resources of various professions have been included in this book to provide information on the many different subjects discussed. Although this book is an in-depth study of evolution, it was written on the level so that the average teenager or adult will be able to understand what is being presented. Difficult words and terms are explained so that you will not need to consult a dictionary every time an unknown word or term appears. I attempted to present the subject matter on a level that most people will be able to easily understand. The various views and arguments are presented in a manner similar to having a debate. The aim of this book is to help either strengthen your current views of origins or cause you to re-think what you currently believe. It is hoped that at least you will develop a better appreciation for the opposing views and will better understand why those who believe in the opposing views believe as they do.

Land and Light in the American West,"""Rather than the proverbial melting pot, Wilson asks us to recognize a West that is at least a place where, against a backdrop of aridity and expansive space, diverse lives can and do coexist."" --John Rohrbach Renowned photographer Laura Wilson has captured the majesty, as well as the tragedy, of her home region of Texas and the wider West for more than three decades. A former assistant to Richard Avedon, she has published her work to wide acclaim over the past twenty-five years. As seen in this extraordinary book, Wilson's subjects range from legendary West Texas cattle ranches to impoverished Plains Indian reservations to lavish border-town cotillions. Also featured are compelling portraits of artists who are associated with the region, including Donald Judd, Ed Ruscha, and Sam Shepard. The unforgettable images in That Day, most of which are previously unpublished, tell sharply drawn stories of the people and places that have shaped, and continue to shape, the nation's most dynamic and unyielding land.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics),"Not that Hemingway was correct, but he did write in 1935: ""All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn;” unless we are to interpret the adjective 'modern' as 'unadorned.' But Hemingway's remark somehow points to the importance of Mark Twain's breezy, fresh, and straight-forward style.Huckleberry Finn is a poor child whose only family is “Pap” —his abusive drunk father. Huck runs away, and meets Jim, a slave, who is also running away. So, here we have from the very beginning of the novel, two heavy topics: child abuse and slavery. Although Mark Twain has been criticized for his stereotypical presentation Jim, he —a white author— imbues Jim with much humanity in an era in which slaves were considered sub-human. Had any other writer dare do such a thing? Dis anyone else besides Jane Austen write about the slave trade? It took courage to deal with such themes. But Mark Twain also threw other ethical dilemmas into the fray: It is right to obey wrong laws? Should the individual suffer to preserve society?Hence the universal importance of the book.To do honor to the original version, my editorial corrections are minimal. The language —including the dialects— have been left untouched, as well as terms today deemed offensive.","['Mark Twain', 'Marciano Guerrero']",Createspace Independent Pub,2014-09-27,['Fiction'],0762405414,A2XAWBF5J47ECS,0/0,5.0,1018828800,One of the Top Ten Best Books Ever!!,"This book is about a boy who was taken in by a nice widow to be protected by his drunken father.

Doc Holliday,"John H. Holliday, D. D. S., better known as Doc Holliday, has become a legendary figure in the history of the American West. In Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait, Karen Holliday Tanner reveals the real man behind the legend. Shedding light on Holliday’s early years, in a prominent Georgia family during the Civil War and Reconstruction, she examines the elements that shaped his destiny: his birth defect, the death of his mother and estrangement from his father, and the diagnosis of tuberculosis, which led to his journey west. The influence of Holliday’s genteel upbringing never disappeared, but it was increasingly overshadowed by his emerging western personality. Holliday himself nurtured his image as a frontier gambler and gunman. Using previously undisclosed family documents and reminiscences as well as other primary sources, Tanner documents the true story of Doc’s friendship with the Earp brothers and his run-ins with the law, including the climactic shootout at the O. K. Corral and its aftermath. This first authoritative biography of Doc Holliday should appeal both to historians of the West and to general readers who are interested in his poignant story. ""Doc Holliday: A Family Portrait will be considered the definitive Holliday biography and will supplant all previously published works on the man’s life as a complete and authoritative account.

I believe that this book is the best of the many volumes that Myers wrote on the history of the West. Myers brings just the right voice to the story - an idiosyncratic style of telling a tale full of colorful idioms and turns of phrase that perfectly match a history full of people with monikers like Doc, Big Nose Kate, and Curly Bill.Myers was a great folk historian. While he did solid research on his subjects, he realized that the legends that grew up around certain characters had as much historical importance as the facts of their life. Often when writing histories of the West, verifiable facts are few, and legends are plentiful. This was certainly the case when Myers wrote `Doc Holiday'. Yet he was able to use what was known to weave a fascinating tale that rings true. History, after all, is more art form than science, and Myer's ""Doc Holiday' should survive more academic efforts that have missed this point in a quixotic quest for ""just the facts, ma'am"".Doc Holliday, both by the circumstances of his time and place, and apparently by his own design, left a scant official record of his passing among us, but he blazed a wide trail in the legend that he left behind. Myers did a fine job of ferreting out the former, and a masterful job of portraying the later. He captured the spirit of the man and the times and wild place in which he lived and moved. This is a book worthy of the legend, and I recommend it highly.Theo Logos",2013,en

More like the pursuit of money leading into happiness. The novel starts off with a dull beginning but soon develops into what is known as one of the greatest written novels during the First World War. In the Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald uses the theme of importance of social class along with money status to show that Mr. Jay Gatsby is a symbol for the average American during the 1920s. The story is narrated by Nick Carraway who is a young lad living in West Egg, Long Island. Next to him lives the infamous Jay Gatsby who falls in love with a taken woman. Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan had met five years earlier and had fallen in love but unfortunately Jay left and was not able to contact Daisy for some time. After waiting for five long years Daisy decides to marry Tom who is one of Nick's friends from college. Sooner or later Gatsby and Daisy meet up again at Nick's house and fall in love all over again. Nick ends up being caught in a love tangle when he finds out that not only are Daisy and Gatsby having an affair but also that Tom has an affair with Myrtle Wilson. In the end three people end up dead due to the entanglement, but it is made clear that Daisy's choice to stay with Tom is solely based upon the recently found news that Gatsby was actually a poor man who inherited money. This then ties in the theme of ""money does matter"" and the downfall of the American society due to a shortage of money in the 1920s seen on pages 40-41. I recommend this book to those who are interested in reading twisted romance novels with a little rising action thrown in.",2016,en

"Colombia and the United States : War, Unrest, and Destabilization (Open Media Series)","Every year the United States spends millions of dollars to help the war-ravaged country of Colombia. But help it with what? In Colombia and the U.S. Mario Murillo explores the misdirected and devastating impact that U.S. military ""aid"" continues to have on the war torn-people of Colombia. Beginning with a brief history of Colombia, Murillo analyzes the complex forces driving Colombia's current decades-old guerilla war, U.S. involvement, media perceptions, and possible paths to peace. Whether it has been the U.S.-led war against ""drug trafficking,"" the newly constituted ""war against terrorism,"" or, as we have seen over the last two years, a convenient marriage of the two, the main effect has been to allow the U.S. to further expand its role in Colombia. The foundations of Colombia's social, political, and military conflict are rarely addressed by U.S. policy. Murillo describes Colombia's history of institutionalized corruption, state neglect, far-reaching poverty, and political violence and how they precede by decades the introduction and expansion of the drug trade. Colombia and the U.S. argues that the conflict in Colombia is not about drugs, nor guerrillas, nor ""terrorism,"" but rather about the unwillingness of the country's elite to open up spaces for truly democratic participation in areas of economic and social development and political representation.",['Mario A.

Murillo. Moreover, ""the nature of Colombia's internal conflict has been completly distorted by the prism of drug-war politics,"" he adds in the opening chapter. To this end, the author provides hard-hitting facts to support his claim that United States aid to Colombia, ""is very often used by the Colombian political and economic elite to promote its own agenda.""Murillo does not stop there...he exposes Colombia's feeble legal system. ""In Colombia, the Constitution and its laws are often ignored and rarely enforced, either because of a lack of bureaucratic capacity on the part of the state to do so, or because of an absence of political will on the part of the ruling elite to execute those laws that are designed to protect the public,"" he reports.The author has few kind words for President Alvaro Uribe. Murillo attacks the politically motivated violence ""by the state and its paramilitary apparatus."" He also is critical of the corruption of the traditional political parties, run predominantly by elites...""who compete for the spoils that serve as an incentive for cycles of generalized corruption.""The origins of the conflict, the myths behind Colombian democracy, the principal actors in today's conflict and the many views in the United States are studied in detail in this text. The analysis of the paramilitaries in Colombia is brilliant...particularly in respect to the millions of displaced people and the terrible treatment of Afro-Colombians.Still and all, the best part of this book is the call for change. Murillo slams Alvaro Uribe's unconditional support for George W. Bush and worries that the impunity of the violent actors in Colombia will continue to fuel the civil war. In conclusion, the author clearly states that a pure military solution is impossible and that only true democratic reforms can stop the violence. Recommended.Bert Ruiz",2011,en
Sullivan's Woman,"From #1 New York Times and USA TODAY bestselling author Nora Roberts comes a pair of fan-favorite stories about what happens when love finds you. IRISH REBEL From the moment she meets him, Keeley Grant knows there's something wild about Brian Donnelly.

The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering,"In his iconoclastic and controversial study, Norman G. Finkelstein moves from an interrogation of the place the Holocaust has come to occupy in global culture to a disturbing examination of recent Holocaust compensation settlements. It was not until the Arab–Israeli War of 1967, when Israel’s evident strength brought it into line with US foreign policy, that memory of the Holocaust began to acquire the exceptional prominence it has today. Recalling Holocaust fraudsters such as Jerzy Kosiński and Binjamin Wilkomirski, as well as the demagogic constructions of writers like Daniel Goldhagen, Finkelstein contends that the main danger posed to the memory of Nazism’s victims comes from some of the very people who profess most passionately to defend it. Drawing on a wealth of untapped sources, he exposes the double shakedown of European countries and legitimate Jewish claimants, and concludes that the Holocaust industry has become an outright extortion racket.",['Norman G.

Pegasus Bridge,"In the early morning hours of June 6, 1944, a small detachment of British airborne troops stormed the German defense forces and paved the way for the Allied invasion of Europe. Pegasus Bridge was the first engagement of D-Day, the turning point of World War II. This gripping account of it by acclaimed author Stephen Ambrose brings to life a daring mission so crucial that, had it been unsuccessful, the entire Normandy invasion might have failed. Ambrose traces each step of the preparations over many months to the minute-by-minute excitement of the hand-to-hand confrontations on the bridge.

Crazy-White-Man: (Sha-ga-na-she Wa-du-kee),"The author was a businessman from New York who got tired of the “Big City” life and was unhappy for some time. He decided to move as far away from that environment. Taking only his dog, some gear, and an open heart he travelled to Canada. During this trip, he found an island of epic beauty and decided to purchase it. His story tells of his difficulty trying to adapt to such the harsh environment. The local population were Native Americans who gave him the name “Crazy White Man” for making the changes that he did. Dick Morenus, New York radio and magazine writer, took to the Ontario bush country to shed his ulcers. After writing this hilarious account of his six-year transition from tenderfoot to woodsman-guide, he returned to city life to teach, write, and lecture, CHICAGO TRIBUNE — “As a story of the indomitable spirit of men and women pitted against the overwhelming forces of nature, ‘Crazy-White-Man’ is an inspiring one; as a tale of pure adventure, it will be hard to put down ... a book that is a little classic of the rugged life.” CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR — “ ... one of the best tales of escape from city pressures ... It is a vivid close-up of the Ontario bush—written down with the vividness and gaiety of a man who knew he was free.” NEW YORK TIMES — “Respect for Mr. Morenus’ courage and hardihood grows with every page we read . . . it emerges as a valuable addition to the small number of books about the Canadian bush.” COLORADO SPRINGS FREE PRESS — “Anyone from young to old who has wanted to toss the soft life of today into the discard and live as our ancestors did will enjoy this book. To those who have lived under frontier conditions it will be equally refreshing—and that cannot be said for many of this type.”",['Richard Morenus'],Pickle Partners Publishing,2015-11-06,['Biography & Autobiography'],B0007DLNTC,A175QDC7DMPHB7,0/0,5.0,1337212800,making the north country come alive,"I'd just like to chime in that this book is one of my all-time favorites. I first encountered it many years ago in our cabin on a lake in eastern Ontario. As the other reviewers indicate, this book wonderfully conveys the feel of the raw power and charm of the Canadian north country, or ""bush"" . You feel sympathy for Richard Morenus' humility and willingness to learn from his mistakes in the unforgiving wilds. It's a story of his forsaking the comforts of a stressful but secure job in the radio business in the 1940's to live on a remote island near Sioux Lookout, Ontario by himself, with his beloved dog Nik. He goes into touching detail of his struggle to survive the first harsh winter, including having to spend countless hours just to chop wood in the dead of winter to heat his drafty cabin. Yet it's also a book full of people, for Richard goes out of this way to befriend the locals, both white and Ojibway Indian, or as they might prefer to be called today, First Nations. His book was written before the advent of the loud and noxious snowmobile, so we encounter him in his intrepid effort to control a dog team and sled. He tries his hand at being a guide to fishermen and hunters, and we are rewarded with comical descriptions of tourist ineptitude that narrowly avoid the tragic. His portrayals of aboriginal life are on the whole balanced and penetrating, though one feels the cultural distance between the present time and the paternalistic attitudes that prevailed back then. Thus, he befriends a local chief by the name of Wa-she-ga and makes a serious effort to learn the Ojibway language, an effort all the more commendable when one understands that no textbooks or primers or grammars in the language were available to him. One must also realize that the full impact of time-compressed modernity on the indigenous people had not yet occurred when he wrote his book. Story-telling is another of his strong points, and the later part of the book is a series of collected stories of life in the bush, both white and Ojibway. If you like Jack London, you'll love those stories. For instance, there's the story of the ""Sourdough"" and his perilous journey across the barrens of the far north in search of gold. There's pioneer woman Anna Olsen's dramatic escape from a raging forest fire. One story, though, strains the credulity. It's the story of Packwash Lake, which supposedly claims a life a year. If that's so, there's nothing to show for it in the numerous postings about the lake that turned up my Google searches. No story of the north is complete without encounters with bears and other wildlife, and you'll find them here as well. Richard came to love the bush, in spite of the hard, back-breaking work needed just to survive, and stayed on his island for six years before returning to ""civilization"". Why did he finally leave the bush? Read the book! The chapter illustrations are well done. I'd love to see his island sometime.",2015,en

The opression of women in the 1800s and how it destroyed some brilliant people; or maybe even kept them from becoming real people. While we were discussing this book in class, a classmate of mine said that Edna seemed to be copying the actions of those around her because she hadn't been able to develop her own personality. I think we all know how that is, sometimes. I think that idea would be interesting in a modern setting.

THE WHITE BOOK becomes a meditation on the color white, as well as a fictional journey inspired by an older sister who died in her mother's arms, a few hours old. The narrator grapples with the tragedy that has haunted her family, an event she colors in stark white--breast milk, swaddling bands, the baby's rice cake-colored skin--and, from here, visits all that glows in her memory: from a white dog to sugar cubes. As the writer reckons with the enormity of her sister's death, Han Kang's trademark frank and chilling prose is softened by retrospection, introspection, and a deep sense of resilience and love.

Leaves of grass,"Leaves of Grass is a poetry collection by the American poet Walt Whitman (1819–1892). Though the first edition was published in 1855, Whitman spent his entire life writing and re-writing Leaves of Grass, revising it in several editions until his death. This resulted in vastly different editions over four decades—the first a small book of twelve poems and the last a compilation of over 400 poems.The poems of Leaves of Grass are loosely connected and each represents Whitman's celebration of his philosophy of life and humanity. This book is notable for its discussion of delight in sensual pleasures during a time when such candid displays were considered immoral. Where much previous poetry, especially English, relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, Leaves of Grass (particularly the first edition) exalted the body and the material world. Influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Transcendentalist movement, itself an offshoot of Romanticism, Whitman's poetry praises nature and the individual human's role in it. However, much like Emerson, Whitman does not diminish the role of the mind or the spirit; rather, he elevates the human form and the human mind, deeming both worthy of poetic praise.",['Walt Whitman'],Createspace Independent Pub,2014-09-09,['Poetry'],B0006AF9UU,A3E9755POMX4K8,0/0,4.0,1356480000,Leaves of Grass,A lot of his work at no cost!

In one act of terrorism, an engineered petroleum bacterium has brought the world to a standstill. Free thought, free will, industry, culture, diversity and imagination have now become things of the past.In its place resting on the ashes of the 21st century and all it encompassed, is a world shaped by scalpel. This is the world that Tally Youngblood unknowingly lives in. As a fifteen year old ""Ugly"", Tally looks forward to her 16th birthday. That is when she will be whisked off to complete her transformation from an ""Ugly"" to a ""Pretty""-where beauty's specifications are cunningly determined by the Pretty Committee.But what she doesn't know it's that that not only her body will be changed, but her mind. Just mere weeks before her operation date, she meets Shay, another Ugly in the dorm. Shay seems to know of a world that operates outside of Uglyville and New Pretty Town-a mysterious backwoods utopia known as The Smoke-where the government can't get at you. But getting there might end up costing too much. And what Tally and Shay don't know is that the government will do anything to crush The Smoke and its rebellion. Including using her and Shay to their own ends.Westerfeld knows the intricacies of humanity's foibles and he exploits them in his terrifying vision of the future, where everyone looks alike, acts alike, thinks alike, and only a select few are chosen to think freely. The human race is depicted as operating with such diminished capacity that readers will cringe, and Westerfeld manages to encapsulate the conflict and pressures of superficiality that plagues society today. What could be scarier: A future where the government controls your actions or where they actually tamper with your mind?

Today is the day Benjie Chávez and his family will leave the town of Guadalupe behind. Far from the land of the eagle and the nopal, they travel west to find a new home of opportunity. But adapting to the big, impersonal city of Albuquerque is no easy task. As both life and death come to the barrio, a blind seer named Crispin arrives in the Chávezes’ world. At first everyone dismisses his stories about an elusive place called Aztlán as the ramblings of an old man. But gradually, they come to realize that he can see what they cannot. With his potent blend of earthy prose and magic realism, bestselling author Rudolfo Anaya excavates his country’s legends to tell a spellbinding story of myth and migration, love and loss.

Admittedly, it isn't up to the level of Anaya's best work (i.e.Bless Me, Ultima), and its flaws are pretty obvious. It's an unbalanced novel. So much space of the novel is spent following Jason and his struggles in a school that devalues him and his culture, and his story seems quite unfinished at the end of the novel. The magical realism is fine and important but is so suddenly introduced in the novel as to feel an intrusion. I've no problem with the presence or the shape of politics in this novel, but I did feel that Anaya was a little heavy-handed in its treatment. The beginning half of the novel is, to be honest, pretty dull.And yet, despite these frustrations I have with the book, it has a lot of merit. There is a lot of heart in this story. The loss of land; the struggles of being caught up in the dehumanizing crush of work in the train yards and life in the city; the hopelessness and self-hatred that can be acquired in the schools; the strains that being poor, powerless, and marginalized can press upon a family; the sad plight of the family who is ostracized from even their own community--each of these struggles is vividly and compassionately depicted in the novel. And working against these forces is Clemente's rising consciousness, and the myths that he is coming to embody and invoke. When I get to the novel's ending (I won't give it away), it feels really right and really feels like something has been said in this book. The ending feels artistic, mythically charged, and you leave the novel with a sense of urgency, the desire to work toward a more just world.So, it's not a perfect novel, not for everyone's taste, but it is, ultimately, a worthwhile novel, with something to say.",2015,en

But the bad guys are never really fully described, and the threat never feels personal. (This is in stark contrast to another of her best books, ""Over the Edge"", where, with Gina's story, you feel the very real threat throughout the whole book.)There is tension in this book, but it's mainly ""please don't do anything dumb"" tension as the main characters seem to make stupid decision after stupid decision, whether in their actions or their love decisions.All of this being said, Suzanne Brockmann still writes a gripping story that I had a hard time putting down.

The Birth of the Republic 1763-89,"In The Birth of the Republic, 1763–89, Edmund S. Morgan shows how the challenge of British taxation started Americans on a search for constitutional principles to protect their freedom, and eventually led to the Revolution. By demonstrating that the founding fathers’ political philosophy was not grounded in theory, but rather grew out of their own immediate needs, Morgan paints a vivid portrait of how the founders’ own experiences shaped their passionate convictions, and these in turn were incorporated into the Constitution and other governmental documents. The Birth of the Republic is the classic account of the beginnings of the American government, and in this fourth edition the original text is supplemented with a new foreword by Joseph J. Ellis and a historiographic essay by Rosemarie Zagarri.",['Edmund S. Morgan'],University of Chicago Press,2012-12-15,['History'],B000GS03PS,A4NG0X67UZ8WW,0/0,5.0,1359072000,Doesn't compromise depth in it's achievement of brevity,"Edmund S. Morgan has written a highly readable introduction to the American Revolution for anyone looking to re-educate themselves on the founding of the United States or delve in for the first time (if you happened to of slept through high school history). This is a book which would be excellent in a university survey course and I am saddened that it was not required reading for myself while in college. I undoubtedly plan on using excerpts from it when teaching in my own high school history course and looking to bring in outside sources.The book itself highlights all of the main events which constituted the Revolution and early republic. It covers the various Acts imposed by Parliament which led up to the Declaration of Independence, several key battles, the main cast of characters and Founding Fathers, the challenges faced by the young republic, and concludes with the 'critical period' and ratification of the constitution. Those anticipating detailed accounts of how particular battles were won or lost though will be disappointed, as this is not the focus of the book.I believe that this piece works so well because of Professor Morgan's success at covering the main events, pointing out areas of academic/moral debate, and then arguing his own point of view in an even-handed and defensible way. He points out the hypocrisy of numerous founders owning slaves, but also emphasizes the need the founders had of ratifying the constitution in order to preserve the young Union and the fact that they would have been unable to do this had the north pushed strongly for emancipation. This haste in working towards ratification led to 'compromises' which invariably hurt women and slaves, and greatly delayed freedom and suffrage. Also, he makes a nod towards those historians who diminish the Founding Fathers as men only concerned with their economic well-being, but argues that they were also indeed men of principle.I found this a very enjoyable book and even if you are in disagreement with some of his opinions, it is hard to deny its accomplishment in brevity (without lacking in depth) and well-written style. I greatly enjoyed it and recommend it highly to any seeking a refresher in basic US history.",2012,en

Using everyday language, spatial concepts, visualizations, and his renowned ""Feynman diagrams"" instead of advanced mathematics, Feynman clearly and humorously communicates both the substance and spirit of QED to the layperson.

James Lee Burke does that for me. His book ""Cimarron Rose"" is a good example of his stellar performance.""Cimarron Rose,"" one of Burke's Billy Bob Holland novels, is the story of Billy Bob's search for the killer of a killer and his adolescent associates when a teen age girl is killed in a hangout popular with teenagers wilding. In that, maestro Billy Bob Holland takes the lead defending an adolsecent whose lower class family background preselect him as victim. In the episode that follows Billy Bob kicks open a giant hole in town corruption, wealthy power and seemingly immoral leaders of the social upper crust.Billy Bob, raw fisted and quick tempered, seems to embody the fighting truth seeker a la Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer of 50 years ago. This novel is replete with uncountable fist, knife, and gunfights, mano a mano among the bad guys of ""Cimarron Rose.""In this novel, author Burke follows the progress of attorney Billy Bob Holland gathering evidence of his client's innocence and stirs up a hornets's nest of the rich and their ties with evil forces in American life. The plot and conflict=tension is further enhanced by Billy Bob's dead friend, a PTSD-like ghost enduced by a shoot out with drug runners in northern Mexico, and wisdom found in reading his father's diaries.Author Burke's skills with characterization lie in his deft use of short descriptions such as: ""On the trial he met a hollow-eyed preacher whose face had been branded with red hot horseshoes by Comanches north of the Cimarron""; ""L.Q. Navarro [the ghost partner] sat on top of a stall, the heels of his boots hooked onto a plank""; ""Mary Beth Sweeny . . . still in uniform from the night shift, her thumbs hooked into the sides of her gun belt"". With these short machine gun bursts of colorful description, author Burke develops his characters, depicts attitude, and progresses the action all in a single phrase.Like the real estate legend of ""location , location, location,"" in crime novels it's ""plot, plot, plot."" At that, James Lee Burk is the master plotster.As conflict after conflict, each more life-threatening to allies, it's Billy Bob's personal and cool-headed rage that saves the day time to time. But, that's not to say his sticking his head into the lion's mouth is not dangerous -- because it IS dangerous, but author Burke has developed tough but likeable heroes and we fear for their lives.Finally, James Lee Burke's ""Cimarron Rose"" will bowl you over with his ""writerly"" prose, i.e., control over language that literally sparkles with new views of life, e.g., ""She pulled her T shirt over her head, her hair collapsing on her shoulders""; ""he had crashed through the enemy line like a tank through a hedgerow""; ""The headlights shone in my driveway, bounced across the chicken run and filled the barn and horse lot with shadows"". If you like an unbridled wordsmith at the top of his game,you'll be as crazy as I am for the work of James Lee Burke. A solid read from the first word to the last.",2021,en

The Light Princess,"Originally published in 1864, this story centers a young princess who’s cursed with the inability to touch the ground, but still finds love and happiness. The Light Princess is about sacrifice and redemption, while facing unsurmountable odds. When a witch isn’t invited to a royal christening, she curses the child with a “loss of gravity.” The young princess constantly floats on air and can only find relief while in water. Due to her circumstance, she remains figuratively and literally distant. This becomes a greater problem when her family discovers the only way to break the curse is through tears. The princess must experience the power of love and loss before she can finally be free. . The Light Princess is one of George MacDonald’s most notable works.

A starry-eyed young beauty, Marjorie Morgenstern is nineteen years old when she leaves home to accept the job of her dreams--working in a summer-stock company for Noel Airman, its talented and intensely charismatic director. Released from the social constraints of her traditional Jewish family, and thrown into the glorious, colorful world of theater, Marjorie finds herself entangled in a powerful affair with the man destined to become the greatest--and the most destructive--love of her life.

Ellen is vanaf haar vijfde een weeskind en wordt onder hoede genomen door haar oom en tante. Zij laten haar keer op keer weten dat wat ze ook in haar leven zal bereiken, aan hun hartelijk te danken is. Wanneer de verloving met haar nieuwe vlam zich nadert, pleegt hij plotseling zelfmoord.

Her cousin Esmeralda (Agatha and Josiah's daughter) never saw her as the poor relation, only as her friend whom she adored.It was hoped--mostly by Agatha--that Esmeralda marry Phillip Carrington, the rich bachelor she felt worthy of her daughter. Much to Agatha's chigrin, Phillip picks Ellen to be his bride on the eve of Esmeralda's coming out party and coincidently the night Agatha assumed he would be claiming Esmeralda as his choice of bride.Ellen's life as the poor relation changes overnight until Phillip is suddenly taken from her. With heavy sadness in her heart, she receives word that her cousin Jago--several times removed--has been looking for her. She is the heir to an island and a vast fortune left by the father whom she thinks never wanted anything to do with her.She learns of an older sister named Silva. But what happened to her? Where is she? Dead? How did she die and why didn't anyone see her leave the island? There are a lot of twists and turns to this story and it will keep you interested and turning the pages until the end.Reviewed for Suspense Magazine by: Terri Ann Armstrong, Author of ""Morning Menace"", published by Suspense Publishing, a company owned by Suspense Magazine.""Reviews within this magazine are the opinions of the individual reviewers and are provided solely to provide readers assistance in determining another's thoughts on the book under discussion and shall not be interpreted as professional advice or the opinion of any other than the individual reviewer.

Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide,"From the author of the best-selling memoir An Unquiet Mind, comes the first major book in a quarter century on suicide, and its terrible pull on the young in particular. Night Falls Fast is tragically timely: suicide has become one of the most common killers of Americans between the ages of fifteen and forty-five. An internationally acknowledged authority on depressive illnesses, Dr. Jamison has also known suicide firsthand: after years of struggling with manic-depression, she tried at age twenty-eight to kill herself. Weaving together a historical and scientific exploration of the subject with personal essays on individual suicides, she brings not only her remarkable compassion and literary skill but also all of her knowledge and research to bear on this devastating problem. This is a book that helps us to understand the suicidal mind, to recognize and come to the aid of those at risk, and to comprehend the profound effects on those left behind. It is critical reading for parents, educators, and anyone wanting to understand this tragic epidemic.",['Kay Redfield Jamison'],Vintage,2011-01-12,['Psychology'],0756765595,A3ER23TCH8HOJB,0/8,5.0,1274140800,Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide/Kay Redfield Jamison,"This book was described with leather covering, a collectable, a leather letter bookmarker.

Anna and the King of Siam,"Based on the incredible true story of one woman’s journey to the exotic world of nineteenth-century Siam, the riveting novel that inspired The King and I. In 1862, recently widowed and with two small children to support, British schoolteacher Anna Leonowens agrees to serve as governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam (present-day Thailand), unaware that her years in the royal palace will change not only her own life, but also the future of a nation. Her relationship with King Mongkut, famously portrayed by Yul Brynner in the classic film The King and I, is complicated from the start, pitting two headstrong personalities against each other: While the king favors tradition, Anna embraces change. As governess, Anna often finds herself at cross-purposes, marveling at the foreign customs, fascinating people, and striking landscape of the kingdom and its harems, while simultaneously trying to influence her pupils—especially young Prince Chulalongkorn—with her Western ideals and values. Years later, as king, this very influence leads Chulalongkorn to abolish slavery in Siam and introduce democratic reform based on the ideas of freedom and human dignity he first learned from his beloved tutor. This captivating novel brilliantly combines in-depth research—author Margaret Landon drew from Siamese court records and Anna’s own writings—with richly imagined details to create a lush portrait of 1860s Siam. As a Rodgers & Hammerstein Broadway musical and an Academy Award–winning film, the story of Anna and the King of Siam has enchanted millions over the years. It is a gripping tale of cultural differences and shared humanity that invites readers into a vivid and sensory world populated by unforgettable characters.",['Margaret Landon'],Open Road Media,2016-08-23,['Fiction'],B0006AQGL6,A136ICCD6UNSHU,41/56,5.0,944006400,History is flavored by present day attitudes.,"In this age of post-modern political correctness it is easy to rewrite history using emotion in place of the facts. This book tells a story that not everyone wants to hear, now that the influence of Western thought and culture on the East is seen more as oppressive aggrandizement rather than the educational enlightenment it truly was.That the 19th century ruler chose a woman to educate himself and his children (and therefore, his country) shows clearly that Mongkut's political motivations were to gain knowledge without being dominated by a western pedagogue. Mongkut realized that, to enter the modern age, he needed to tap into elements of the west's (in some ways more advanced) culture, and do it without making himself vulnerable to the sometimes heavy-handed white male missionaries who were clamoring to &quot;enlighten&quot; any non-Christian regions of the Earth. In any event, it is clear that Mongkut could not have achieved as much as he did without the help of Leonowens, and the hand wringers who would deny her any credit at all do great disservice to the memories of both historic figures. It is also interesting to note that those who doubt the veracity of Leonowens' story have motivations that stem most distinctly from the fact that she was a woman.",2016,en

The first review, of'Twas the Night Before Christmas (Candy Cane Books)began with a sentence I'm going to copy and paste here: While there's no question that the original poem by Clement Moore is a five star piece of work, there are so many versions of this poem in print that any review has to be of the entire book, with more weight on the illustrations, the only difference between them. I suggest potential customers pay attention to which reviews apply to which book, as there's quite a difference in quality.The classic poem, wherein the narrator hears noise on the lawn on Christmas Eve and, responding to it, sees Santa in his sleigh land on the roof, come down the chimney, etc. The narrator, the father of the family, watches Santa place gifts under the tree and, when done, hop in his sleigh and fly away.ISBN 0785313648 - (3 stars) The cover illustration, by Linda Graves, is the best of the lot here. The illustrations inside the book, by Susan Spellman, are average and some are even a bit clumsy. You should certainly have a copy of Moore's poem on hand - there's no childhood complete without it! - but this is not the most worthwhile version out there.ISBN 158845374x - (4 stars) - Part of the Santa's Little Library of Christmas Stories series. This is a very small book, and the story is quite abridged. At 2 x 2 inches, it's great for small hands and fingers and is a wonderful introduction to the longer poem. The illustrations are very cute - the enormous open mouths accompanying ""I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter."" cracked me up!ISBN 0307637506 - (5 stars) Illustrator Cyndy Szekeres and Golden Books measure up to the standard set by Moore. Szekeres's family is one of mice, which always makes for some fun illustrations. The ""wreath"" on the family's door is one leaf and one holly berry; the parents' bed is a sardine can; Santa sits on a single die to review his list and the endtable is a thread spool while a large family photo has a locket for a frame. These little touches of whimsy are fun and cute. All ages love the poem, children in particular will love the mice and their adorable adapted furnishings.ISBN 0307119564 - (3 stars) Illustrators Greg and Tim Hildebrandt did an okay job, just nothing special. The Santa on the cover looks a little bug-eyed, which makes him seem to be leering... which, in turn, makes it an unattractive cover. The inside illustrations are on the old-fashioned side, and they complement the poem well. The detail is nice and the decorated tree is one of the best images - although the decorations on the tree change from page to page. Not bad, just not the best.ISBN 1556702744 - (5 stars) Joyce Patti's illustrations, paired with the unique 3D shadow box pages set this edition apart. The book is small, about 5"" x 5"" and just over 1/2"" thick, which makes it a good take along book, but the delicate-ness of the shadow boxes makes it a poor choice for a child to handle much. As each page is opened, the shadow box will pop up and display a beautiful, multi-layered image. The images are small but remarkably detailed. The trick, by the way, is to make sure you're holding the page edges down with your right thumb, or the effect is lost. A nice presentation of a classic.- AnnaLovesBooks",2011,en

Drawing on her own research on incest, as well as on a vast literature on combat veterans and victims of political terror, she shows surprising parallels between private horrors like child abuse and public horrors like war.

Night She Died,"Julie Holmes has always held a seductive power over men. Her golden hair and deep blue eyes entrance admirers wherever she goes, even after she leaves London for peaceful Kent with her doting husband. But could any of these devotees have become so obsessed as to turn a knife on her? Inspector Thanet refuses to accept this assumption. He is much more curious about the events of a foggy November evening nearly twenty years ago, when Julie was only three, and their link to the hideous nightmares she suffered in the weeks prior to her death.

To Kill A Mockingbird,"Voted America's Best-Loved Novel in PBS's The Great American Read Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning masterwork of honor and injustice in the deep South—and the heroism of one man in the face of blind and violent hatred One of the most cherished stories of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than forty million copies worldwide, served as the basis for an enormously popular motion picture, and was voted one of the best novels of the twentieth century by librarians across the country. A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father—a crusading local lawyer—risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.",['Harper Lee'],Harper Collins,2014-07-08,['Fiction'],B000JJVHZE,A2BZFCW42187H8,1/1,5.0,1050105600,A story told with an innovative style,"'To Kill a mocking bird' is a tapestry of anectodes vividly brought out by an excellent american raconteur - Harper Lee.

Lee achieves this by intertwining the main plot, as if it were unimportant (from the girl's viewpoint), with the story of a mysterious neighbour Boo Radley, whom the trio of Scout, Jem - Scout's tutelary elder brother and Dill - their friend, set out to discover.

One for the Money,"Now available in a special 25th anniversary edition! Discover where it all began—#1 New York Times bestselling author Janet Evanovich’s first “snappily written, fast-paced, and witty” (USA TODAY) novel in the beloved Stephanie Plum series featuring a feisty and funny heroine who “comes roaring in like a blast of very fresh air” (The Washington Post). Meet Stephanie Plum, a bounty hunter with attitude. In Stephanie’s opinion, toxic waste, rabid drivers, armed schizophrenics, and August heat, humidity, and hydrocarbons are all part of the great adventure of living in Jersey. She’s a product of the “burg,” a blue-collar pocket of Trenton where houses are attached and narrow, cars are American, windows are clean, and (God forbid you should be late) dinner is served at six. Out of work and out of money, Stephanie blackmails her bail-bondsman cousin Vinnie into giving her a try as an apprehension agent. Stephanie knows zilch about the job requirements, but she figures her new pal, el-primo bounty hunter Ranger, can teach her what it takes to catch a crook. Her first assignment: nail Joe Morelli, a former vice cop on the run from a charge of murder one. Morelli’s the inamorato who charmed Stephanie out of her virginity at age sixteen. There’s still powerful chemistry between them, so the chase should be interesting…and could also be extremely dangerous.",['Janet Evanovich'],Scribner,2019-06-04,['Fiction'],B000CNRC2E,A1JLKPA3EPLFCP,2/3,5.0,976147200,Funny and offbeat,"_One for the Money_ is the first book in the Stephanie Plum series.

Gerald's Game,"Now a Netflix movie directed by Mike Flanagan (Oculus, Hush) and starring Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood. Master storyteller Stephen King presents this classic, terrifying #1 New York Times bestseller. When a game of seduction between a husband and wife ends in death, the nightmare has only begun… “And now the voice which spoke belonged to no one but herself. Oh my God, it said. Oh my God, I am all alone out here. I am all alone.” Once again, Jessie Burlingame has been talked into submitting to her husband Gerald’s kinky sex games—something that she’s frankly had enough of, and they never held much charm for her to begin with. So much for a “romantic getaway” at their secluded summer home. After Jessie is handcuffed to the bedposts—and Gerald crosses a line with his wife—the day ends with deadly consequences. Now Jessie is utterly trapped in an isolated lakeside house that has become her prison—and comes face-to-face with her deepest, darkest fears and memories. Her only company is that of the various voices filling her mind…as well as the shadows of nightfall that may conceal an imagined or very real threat right there with her…",['Stephen King'],Simon and Schuster,2016-01-01,['Fiction'],B000PGNIAS,A19B0WUZCH8I4R,0/0,5.0,1351123200,Just plain scary.,"I've been a fan of Stephen King's works all my life, but not for the usual reasons. I never found his books frightening, for example. Never really got a chill. They are just good stories, that's what I like most about them. Gerald's Game, however, is of a different make, and anybody who knows King well will tell you the same. The monster from It did not bother me, nor did the car from Christine, but the getting handcuffed to a bed in the middle of nowhere and your lover dying in the middle of the act? Now that is friggin' scary, cause it could happen (it might be happening somewhere right now), and then you really would be left alone with nothing but your own mind to play chess with.Unlike a lot of King's other books, this one is concise, pointed, with absolutely nothing extraneous. A pure psychological horror story, I guess you could call it. Like Psycho. I get the feeling Game was a kind-of novella that got out of control, but however it ended up is right as it is, you can tell that from the first twenty pages or so. There is no letup, no distractions, and no mercy in this one. No sympathy for poor participant or even poor reader. Seems almost like it should have been written during King's black period, when he was drunk and/or drug-addicted. But it wasn't. He was healthy here, yet inexplicably presenting us with this new nightmare that almost everybody can relate to ...I'm a pretty hardened reader, but I have to admit, this story unsettled even my sleep for a night or two, so I highly recommend it. You want those special feelings in the tummy, do you? Well then, read this book before putting your head down on the pillow, and you will get em.",2016,en

He never lost site of his ultimate goal. In doing that, he started a revolution that is still being impacted today. It is something that everyone knows about and appreciates. It is only when you pick up his autobiography and find out just really went on; and what he really had to go through just to set his people free.For some younger adults, his book may seem quite boring at times. When you get older though, it all starts to make sense. You might pick it up a few years later and say, ""Oh yeah, that's what he was trying to get across"" or ""He really was fighting for something he believed in more than life."" Many of his thoughts and hopes can be shown in almost every sentence of the book. It is something evident from the very start. ""Long Walk to Freedom"" is indeed a long walk.

King of the World,"The bestselling biography of Muhammad Ali--with an Introduction by Salman Rushdie On the night in 1964 that Muhammad Ali (then known as Cassius Clay) stepped into the ring with Sonny Liston, he was widely regarded as an irritating freak who danced and talked way too much. Six rounds later Ali was not only the new world heavyweight boxing champion: He was ""a new kind of black man"" who would shortly transform America's racial politics, its popular culture, and its notions of heroism. No one has captured Ali--and the era that he exhilarated and sometimes infuriated--with greater vibrancy, drama, and astuteness than David Remnick, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Lenin's Tomb (and editor of The New Yorker). In charting Ali's rise from the gyms of Louisville, Kentucky, to his epochal fights against Liston and Floyd Patterson, Remnick creates a canvas of unparalleled richness. He gives us empathetic portraits of wisecracking sportswriters and bone-breaking mobsters; of the baleful Liston and the haunted Patterson; of an audacious Norman Mailer and an enigmatic Malcolm X. Most of all, King of the World does justice to the speed, grace, courage, humor, and ebullience of one of the greatest athletes and irresistibly dynamic personalities of our time.",['David Remnick'],Vintage,2014-04-02,['Biography & Autobiography'],1567403247,A3S2G623N1KDGO,3/3,5.0,939340800,A great boxing book.,"This book was fascinating.

Mr. Remnick has illuminated the times and the political/racial atmosphere in which these fights took place. I found the short biographies of Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston especially enlightening. It's surprising to read how loathed Ali was at the time. And how lucky he was!

Princess Erin—Daughter of the Irish High King, the ebony-haired beauty who swore bitter vengeance on the legendary Norseman who had brought death and destruction to her beloved homeland. Yet, in the great Norse and Irish alliance against the invading Danes, it was her own father who gave her in marriage to her most hated enemy. Bewitched by Olaf's massive strength, seduced by his power, still Erin vowed that neither the wrath of his sword nor the fire of his kiss would sway the allegiance of her proud and passionate heart.",['Heather Graham'],Dell,2012-02-01,['Fiction'],0440129737,AO6LA5FC024AY,0/1,5.0,1248393600,Great Viking Romance Story,"What a wonderful story.

Sandstorm: Policy Failure in the Middle East,"The time has come for a serious debate on the future involvement of the United States in the Middle East and this original and provocative analysis challenges the prevailing wisdom of the Washington foreign policy establishment. Hadar provides a sweeping reexamination of the conceptual bases of American policy and proposes a strategy of ""constructive disengagement"" from the region, a policy of benign neglect as a way of promoting the interests of the United States as well as those of the people of the Middle East. In Sandstorm, Hadar calls for regional states and the European Union to take increased responsibility for security, economic growth, and political stability. This bold and innovative critique will inject new energy into the policy debate.",['Leon Hadar'],St. Martin's Press,2015-03-31,['Political Science'],1403967245,A3E36T3KUG4ODA,6/8,5.0,1139875200,Great book,"Although I do not quite agree with all of the conclusions arrived at in Sandstorm, the book deserves nothing less than five stars for its discussion of a wide range of issues surrounding the Middle East and its information and commentary on modern Middle East history. This is a great read for anyone interested in, among other things, the European-American dispute over Middle East policy, the neoconservative strategy for the region, problems associated with maintaining hegemony in the Middle East, the truth about oil, Arab and Israeli lobbyists in Washington, and the Arab-Israeli conflict, of which there is a wealth of sound analysis. Hadar's book presents many facts and makes many strong points that clearly refute prevalent thinking on many of these and other related issues.Hadar refers to the decades-old U.S. policy in the Middle East that originated during the Cold War era, and which he contends was suitable for the circumstances of the Cold War, as America's Middle East Paradigm, or MEP. The basic purpose of the book is to show that the high level of intervention the MEP requires is no longer necessary with the Soviet Union gone.Here are some of Hadar's most important points:U.S. interests are being damaged by the continuing involvement in the Middle East, which tends to only create new problems, e.g. the funding of the mujahedeen in Afghanistan during the 1980s gave birth to Al-Qaeda and, more recently, a Shiite fundamentalist government has risen to power in Iraq thanks to the removal of Saddam's military regime.There is an inherent contradiction in the Bush administration's agenda of imperialism and spreading democracy, because the U.S.'s dominant position in the Middle East will only be threatened and weakened by the results of democratic elections in the region [this book was published too soon to mention it, but the recent Hamas victory in the Palestinian elections serves as proof of Hadar's argument].The dispute between Europe and the U.S. over Middle East policies generally and the war in Iraq particularly is not a clash between political cultures, but rather a clash caused by differing interests; this point runs contrary to what neoconservatives say on a regular basis, and Hadar completely shoots down their arguments in explaining this point.The U.S. should stop providing military and economic aid to Middle East elites because it only encourages them to refrain from reform and agreement with rivals in their own countries, and thereby prevents the development of any sort of political legitimacy in the Middle East.A major misconception is that the U.S. economy is dependent on Middle Eastern oil; in reality, the largest source of foreign oil for the U.S. is Latin America and the U.S. gets the overwhelming majority [90% according to oil expert Daniel Yergin] of its crude oil supplies from parts of the world other than the Middle East.With the Soviet Union defunct, the U.S. no longer should be securing access to Middle Eastern oil for the Europeans and the Japanese, who are, unlike the U.S., both dependent on the region's oil and should now start to pay the military and economic costs of protecting access to it.With the Cold War over, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has become a local struggle over territory and is no longer a stage of global competition between great superpowers.By pursuing a radical Zionist agenda, Israeli nationalist governments make their country dependent on the United States for security and protection.The Palestinian-Israeli conflict will only end when both sides are exhausted and engage in direct negotiations, as in the case of the 1993 Oslo accords, when the U.S. was not involved at all in the talks.U.S. involvement in the Arab-Israeli conflict makes peace less likely and ultimately ignites anti-Americanism in the Arab world because it creates expectations that are never realized; this was demonstrated by the Clinton administration's hyperactive diplomatic role in the failed Camp David negotiations that helped trigger the Second Intifadah.U.S. attempts at resolving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict serve neither U.S. interests nor Israeli interests.It is simply impossible for any one country, or ""actor,"" to impose a single agenda on the Middle East because of the various tribal, religious, ethnic, national, regional, and extra regional political players in the Middle East and the shifting patterns of allegiances that they form and the counter-efforts of securing support of local and international powers that they make when they're unsatisfied with the status quo or certain developments; this is a point that really needs to be made to those who truly believe that a democratic transformation of the region can take place.Both the administrations of the first President Bush and Clinton did not adjust U.S. policies in the Middle East in order to respond to the changing realities of the post-Cold War era; instead they erroneously continued the Cold War-era pursuit of regional hegemony.",2015,en

Societies that had had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed religion --as well as nasty germs and potent weapons of war --and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures. A major advance in our understanding of human societies, Guns, Germs, and Steel chronicles the way that the modern world came to be and stunningly dismantles racially based theories of human history.

Their Eyes Were Watching God,"Their Eyes Were Watching God is a 1937 novel by African-American writer Zora Neale Hurston. It is considered a classic of the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, and it is likely Hurston's best known work.",['Zora Neale Hurston'],Prabhat Prakashan,2020-05-30,['Reference'],079104520X,A2MEJ7O8FEJ485,0/0,5.0,1043798400,"Eye on the prize, telling a good tale, and creating a legacy","To write such a seminal novel as Their Eyes Were Watching God, and for it to become a signature piece says quite a bit for a book that went out of print not long after its first appearance. Coincidentally, it stayed out of print for nearly 30 years. Like the proverbial lore of the Phoenix rising, it not only adds resilience to the author&#65533;s legacy but proves without a doubt that good works&#65533;even neglected ones should be reexamined for overall viability and content analysis despite determined imperviousness to shame. The previous statement alludes itself to efforts by the establishment not understanding the style in which it was written, and the authors&#65533; ways of languishing (albeit negatively) in the public&#65533;s eye. To understand this novel, one first need to know that Zora doesn&#65533;t write directly about black people in the context of a white singular world, but writes exclusively within the confines of black expressionism. This is a book that, despite its lofty status as a classical force of a national epic, it offers a people his or her own spoken language freshly caught on paper and raised to the heights of poetry.Their Eyes&#65533;has universal implications for women in that it protests against the restrictions and limitations imposed upon women by a masculine society. Zora illustrates and give credence to a heroine, Janie Crawford, who must make a major decision about the course of her life. This fluid love story full of thoughtful interpretative realism, pays tribute to a black woman, who, thought constricted by the signs of the times, still demanded to be heard. The characters resonate with colorful imagery: Janie&#65533;s three husbands, Mir. Killicks, Mayor Starks, her best friend Phoeby, Tea Cake, and the other images that she allows to come to life. The story is rather awkwardly told by both Janie, and an omniscient narrator, and is revealed, for the most part, in a flashback to Phoeby Watson. The key to the novel is Janie&#65533;s idea of marriage, which is pitted against other, less romantic ideas of a perfect union. Janie ends up on trial for the murder &#65533; in self-defense &#65533;of the man she loved. The people who knew the couple side against her at the trial, hoping to see her hanged. It is the whites &#65533;the judge and jury, and a group of women originally gathered just for curiosity&#65533;s sake &#65533; which see into the anguished depths of a black woman&#65533;s love and acknowledge her dignity and ultimate innocence. Janie feels no compulsion to justify herself to the town, but she gives more homage and insightful explanation to Phoeby.This is a book that should be read by all, with its main thrust toward life and the fact of it being an affirmation rather than denial of why women possess much more strength than men&#65533;at least in this adaptation. I like it because it speaks for the self, for equality, for the pursuit of happiness instead of possessions, and lastly, it speaks for and seems to recommend a way of life uncluttered by tradition, sterotypes, and materialism. Zora had the right idea and made statements. She left us with a good signature, reminding us that we may yet learn the possibilities of ourselves only &#65533;If you kin see de light at daybreak, you don&#65533;t keer if you die at dusk wit so many people never seein&#65533; de light at all.

Gift and Giver: The Holy Spirit for Today,"In Gift and Giver, leading New Testament scholar Craig Keener takes a probing look at the various evangelical understandings of the role of the Holy Spirit in the church. His desire is for Christians to ""work for consensus, or at least for unity in God's work despite our differences on secondary matters."" Employing a helpful narrative approach and an ample number of stories, Keener enters into constructive dialogue with Pentecostals, moderates, and cessationists, all the while attempting to learn from each viewpoint. He seeks to bridge the gap between cessationists and Pentecostals/charismatics by urging all Christians to seek the Holy Spirit's empowerment. His irenic approach to this controversial issue has been endorsed by charismatics and non-charismatics alike. Sure to provoke helpful dialogue on a topic that has caused unfortunate divisions within the church, Gift and Giver will be a valuable addition to college and seminary courses on pneumatology.

One quibble though, Keener says Luke never mentions anywhere in Acts that the Spirit is concerned with salvation, but that is simply not true. Acts 15 describes how the baptism of the Spirit on Cornelius' house and Peter's seeing it was evidence that God accepted the Gentiles. This of course is a great definition of salvation, the acceptance of us, adoption, if you will, of us as His children. So it muddies the water a bit as to how Luke viewed the baptism of the Spirit. Acts 15 leans closer to what Paul was saying about it in Ephesians 1:13 - a seal, a promise. I agree with Keener that the baptism of the Spirit is technically separate from actual conversion, but it is the experential counterpart and confirmation of salvation",2020,en
